            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my collection of tips on making combat encounters exciting and engaging, instead of tedious and boring.</p>
<h1 id="make-combat-short"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#make-combat-short"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Make Combat Short</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make combat lethal by increasing damage and reducing HP (for players and enemies). It will also encourage players to plan ahead and actually care about getting hit.</li>
<li>When the players gain significant advantage - enemies can run away, beg for mercy, try to negotiate, offer to betray their master, etc.</li>
<li>Allow instant kills. When players come up with a brilliant idea or a super exciting move - let them have their moment, don't make them roll for damage, let them defeat the enemy in one awesome move.</li>
<li>If you notice players getting bored or running out of cool ideas to try, then fudge the numbers and get it over with.</li>
<li>Use a timer. Give players 1 minute to decide and describe what they do for their move. This adds tension, and encourages players to plan their move while the others are taking their turn, maintaining engagement.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="set-up-exciting-situations"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#set-up-exciting-situations"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Set up Exciting Situations</h1>
<p>Make action scenes interesting the same way writers/screenwriters do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it dramatic, meaningful to the characters and to the story, create high stakes and important consequences (Luke fighting his own father, Frodo vs Gollum in the Mount Doom).</li>
<li>Create cool set pieces that put characters in unique/interesting situations (fighting on the roof of a moving train, collapsing buildings, on top of a blimp, Jack Sparrow fighting on top of the mast, Inception Hallway fight, Mad Max, etc.)</li>
<li>Make vivid and cinematic (but concise) descriptions. Read screenplays for great examples. If you're not using a map - make it clear where everyone is in relation to each other.</li>
<li>Take inspiration from books and movies, just copy great action scenes.</li>
<li>Don't do unmotivated random encounters with generic monsters - it's boring and meaningless. Have fewer but more powerful and interesting enemies instead of a bunch of identical repetitive ones.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="make-interesting-interactive-environment"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#make-interesting-interactive-environment"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Make Interesting Interactive Environment</h1>
<p>Make the environment interesting the same way level designers do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create environmental obstacles/hazards (traps, lava pits, rockslides, stampedes, storms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give players opportunities to creatively use their environment (drop a chandelier onto their enemies, set loose wild animals, create a barricade, Jack Sparrow vs Will Turner fight).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Terrain with Elevation (cliff, waterfall, ravine, raging river), difficult terrain (mud, slopes, swamp) and Cover (columns, tall grass, boulders).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Interactable Objects (stalactites, chandeliers, wagons, oil lanterns, curtains, explosive barrels, catapult, single use hand grenade).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make setpiece matter, add environment-related events during combat that demand a response (a wave hitting players and washing them off the ship so they need to climb back on, boulder falls into the river of molten lava causing it to splash over the battlemap).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="encourage-players-to-keep-roleplaying-during-combat"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#encourage-players-to-keep-roleplaying-during-combat"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Encourage Players to keep Roleplaying During Combat</h1>
<ul>
<li>Prompt players to describe their actions. Ask "What your attack looks like?", or more specific questions - “How do you want to engage this creature?” or “How are you planning to get to your ally who is surrounded?”</li>
<li>Encourage banter between players and NPCs during the fight. Give the enemies personalities and desires, make them relatable and interesting to talk to.</li>
<li>Let players contribute their own ideas, add to the environment. When player asks "Is there a tree somewhere? Or any solid vertical plane?" "Is the cave floor smooth or rugged?" it means that they are thinking of ways to interact with the environment. Whenever a player asks "do I see X?" to almost always say yes. If a player comes up with a cool idea - encourage it, let it happen.</li>
<li>Give players or enemies an objective that does not involve direct violence(get  the injured NPC out of the dungeon, end the combat quickly, run away, avoid injuring innocents, steal an item and escape before more guards show up, do it stealthily to avoid attracting more guards, disable an alarm. The enemy might only want to complete the ritual or take an item from the players, the monster might only want to protect it's eggs).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="other"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#other"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Other</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you’re the GM and you want to encourage more narrative creativity - start with yourself, get creative with the combat narration as it happens.</li>
<li>Try to offer interesting/creative/difficult choices every turn. That's what makes it engaging. Create consequences for the choices to make them feel meaningful.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A list of tips to give your players to help them get the most out of your games.</p>
<p>I'm playing one-shots over the discord and it's very helpful to be able to show the new players a list of tips they can follow to help everyone have a great experience. I think it will be good for offline games and campaigns as well. Many tips are inspired by what I have learned from improv, and I think they will help people to tell better stories, and avoid common player problems.</p>
<p>I hope they will be useful to you. If you can think of anything I should add or improve - please let me know!</p>
<h1 id="roleplaying-guidelines"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#roleplaying-guidelines"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Roleplaying Guidelines</h1>
<p>Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our games. If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game.</p>
<h3 id="play-to-find-out-what-happens"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#play-to-find-out-what-happens"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Play to find out what happens</h3>
<p>Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”. Go with the flow, don't try to force preplanned ideas or specific outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="yes-and"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#yes-and"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Yes, and</h3>
<p>Embrace other players’ ideas and build on top of them. Don’t shut down ideas. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for the other characters to shine.</p>
<h3 id="share-the-spotlight"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#share-the-spotlight"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Share the Spotlight</h3>
<p>Avoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation. Help the quieter players to feel included - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.</p>
<h3 id="actively-contribute-ideas-to-the-story"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#actively-contribute-ideas-to-the-story"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Actively contribute ideas to the story</h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid to add information to the story. Try to describe things vividly, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the the missing information, help to create a story that makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="advance-the-plot"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#advance-the-plot"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Advance the Plot</h3>
<p>Help the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.</p>
<h3 id="be-an-active-player"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#be-an-active-player"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Be an active player</h3>
<p>Don't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.</p>
<h3 id="stay-in-character"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#stay-in-character"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Stay in character</h3>
<p>Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.</p>
<h3 id="develop-your-character"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#develop-your-character"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Develop your Character</h3>
<p>What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?</p>
<h3 id="goals-and-motivations"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#goals-and-motivations"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Goals and Motivations</h3>
<p>Figure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?</p>
<h3 id="explore-the-relationships"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#explore-the-relationships"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Explore the Relationships</h3>
<p>How does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?</p>
<p>Create interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?</p>
<h3 id="allow-yourself-to-feel"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#allow-yourself-to-feel"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Allow yourself to feel</h3>
<p>This game can get really amazing when you allow yourself to really feel what your character feels in the moment. When you feel safe to express emotions around your friends, and really care about your character and theirs, you will have some amazing and unforgettable moments.</p>
<h3 id="make-friends"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#make-friends"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Make Friends</h3>
<p>Get to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're struggling to come up with an idea for a character -</p>
<h3 id="take-and-tweak-ideas-from-your-favorite-stories"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#take-and-tweak-ideas-from-your-favorite-stories"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Take and tweak ideas from your favorite stories</h3>
<p>Take your favorite characters from the movies, books, or games you love, and change them in some way:
Adapt them to the genre you're playing in (take your favorite Sci Fi character, and adapt them to fantasy).
Change one of their key personality traits (take a cool villain and create a good version of them, take a shy and humble character and play an exccentric and outgoing version of them, take a high status character and play them as low status).
Reverse their physical characteristics (gender, age, appearance, etc).
Combine characteristics of two different characters into one.
You can google the lists of the top TV/Movie characters, and see which ones you can change in interesting ways, which ones have interesting aspects that you like could combine to create your own character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Iron Man but in a fantasy universe - a brilliant aristocrat inventing steampunk machines in his spare time.</li>
<li>Low-status Gandalf - an ancient wizard shyly mumbling something about the powerful artifact that would be nice to destroy, if that's not too much of an inconvenience to you.</li>
<li>Female Yoda - an old goblin witch people always come to for wisdom and advice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="start-by-choosing-your-appearance"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#start-by-choosing-your-appearance"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Start by choosing your appearance</h3>
<p>Find an image you find inspiring, and use it as a foundation of your character idea.</p>
<p>To find great images - search websites like ArtStation, and Pinterest for things like "Fantasy Character Design", "Paladin", "Ranger", etc. Or view the top posts on /r/ImaginaryCharacters.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-a-superpower"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#start-with-a-superpower"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Start with a superpower</h3>
<p>Finally, you can start with a cool occupation, fantasy race, or a superpower you'd like to have, and build a character around that.</p>
<h3 id="be-yourself"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#be-yourself"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Be yourself</h3>
<p>If all else fails - you can always just play as a fantasy version of yourself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Take this step when you're preparing for the game, it will make you feel much more confident in your ability to run a good adventure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I started doing this deliberately, as one of the steps I take when preparing for the game, I feel much more confident in my ability to run a good adventure.</p>
<p>If you haven't done this before - you really should try it. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picture yourself running the adventure. Imagine sitting at the table and GMing the story for your players, describing the scenes.</li>
<li>Visually imagine the scenes, try to vividly picture what's going on, try to see the whole story as a movie in your head.</li>
<li>Imagine the adventure from the players' perspective, imagine playing through it as your own character.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice all the gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The moments when you can't picture what the scene looks like.</li>
<li>The moments when you don't know what happens next.</li>
<li>The moments when you'd ask some obvious question or take some obvious action as a player, but don't know how to respond to it as a GM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the biggest, most noticeable gaps to the list of open questions. Don't try to account for every small detail - just focus on the things you would find the most difficult to improvise during the game.</p>
<p>Then go through the list and figure out the answers to these questions. Once you're done - you'll feel much more confident that you know the story and can handle whatever the unpredictable players throw at you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#summary"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>In this adventure the players will need to rescue a pack of gigantic fruit bats from a steampunk scientist performing cruel experiments on them.</p>
<p>During their mission they will have to resist the allure of a sentient psychoactive tree, make their way through the dangerous bio-factory producing bizarre eldritch monsters and abominations, escape from a corpse-disassembly machine, only to confront the spider-legged mad scientist in the midst of his laboratory.</p>
<p>During the climactic battle they will have to dodge torrents of mutagenic sludge, and then fly away from the collapsing factory on the backs of the rescued bats.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-version"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pdf-version"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>PDF Version</h2>
<p>You can download this adventure in PDF format:

</Downloads></p>
<h2 id="setting"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#setting"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Setting</h2>
<p>Frankenstein’s castle has been long abandoned, until Doctor Grimworks, the entrepreneurial heir to the castle, has turned it into a factory for producing Chimeras - grotesque combinations of corpses and various animal parts.</p>
<img className="frame medium" src="/post/frankensteins-castle/castle2.jpg"/>
<p>The Chimeras are later sold as tools to perform menial labor, to help with construction, to perform dangerous or difficult jobs (mining, lifting things, delivering heavy objects).</p>
<p>Dr. Grimworks has bioengineered a psychoactive tree (think gigantic Venus flytrap) to  lure and trap various woodland creatures, which are then used in terrible experiments, mutated, or disassembled into parts and used to build Chimeras.</p>
<img className="frame medium" src="/post/frankensteins-castle/evil-tree.jpg"/>
<p>One day the tree has lured a herd of enormous (yet peaceful) fruit bats belonging to an old goblin. Valuable assets to the Doctor, priceless friends and companions to their owner.</p>
<img className="frame medium" src="/post/frankensteins-castle/bat.jpg"/>
<h2 id="meeting-the-old-goblin"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#meeting-the-old-goblin"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meeting the Old Goblin</h2>
<p>It is a dark and stormy night. The players have been traveling through the Romanian forests for days, it’s been raining non-stop, they are drenched, exhausted, and very lost.</p>
<p>When a flash of lightning illuminates the path ahead, they briefly see a silhouette of a humanoid creature with gigantic bat wings sprouting from its back.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, it turns out to be an elderly goblin, with an adorable baby fruit bat perched on its shoulders. The baby bat is gigantic - the size of a grown wolf, it has a broken wing, and the goblin is nursing it back to health.</p>
<CharacterBox frame src="/post/frankensteins-castle/drew.jpg">
<h2 id="old-drew"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#old-drew"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Old Drew</h2>
<p>An elderly goblin. He has raised a herd of gigantic fruit bats who help him to scour the forest in search of the elusive emerald apples, a valuable fruit that nobles will pay good coin for. Old Drew has trained these bats himself and loves them like family.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Old Drew’s precious herd has disappeared into the woods (the bat on his shoulders is the only one who has managed to return), and now he’s walking the forest and crying out the names of his beloved pets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Fluffy! Bertie! Milton! Fungus! Scrappy! Come here little buddy! Peanut! Where are you? Groucho! Puppers! Betty! Tootsie! Wigglebutt! Snuggles! Buck! Otto! McFlufferton!""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After noticing the players, he will beg them for help, offering a bunch of emerald apples (priceless potion ingredients) in return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Me family o’ bats have gone missin’ during the night! Oh I knows you may think I be mad, but me bats are me livelihood. I knew that eerie scent in da’ wood was an ill omen! Please find mah bats, they are well-trained to return to me, I know somn’ terrible musta happened if they can’t!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Old Drew is right. There is an enchanting odor that whaffs through the trees enticing players deeper into the forest...
Players can follow the scent or notice that any rare woodland creatures they see are moving in the same direction.</p>
<h2 id="the-giving-tree"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-giving-tree"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Giving Tree</h2>
<p>The players make their way to a large beautiful tree in full bloom. It’s glowing with faint golden light, emanating peace and comfort - the perfect shelter from the storm.</p>
<p>It has very enticing fruits which are extremely difficult to resist. The tree will speak to the players in a silky voice, inviting them to take a break from the journey and rest in its shade. It will try to convince players to taste its fruit. If they refuse - it will start crying, so distraught that the only human travelers it has met in years don’t want her fruit.</p>
<p>If one of the players succumbs to the temptation, the illusion will dissipate, a flower will close around their hand, ensnaring them, just like it did with many animals before.</p>
<p>The powerful tendrils will wrap around the player, and do their best to drag them towards an open maw at the base of the tree until they’re swallowed up!</p>
<h2 id="to-the-castle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#to-the-castle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>To the Castle</h2>
<p>Behind the tree, farther down the path, difficult to see during the storm, is the Castle Frankenstein.</p>
<p>The tendrils will drag the trapped player through the tree’s root system (which seems, from the inside, like a digestive tract of an enormous animal), and deliver them to the factory inside the castle, dropping them onto the conveyor belt, prompting other players to attempt rescuing them.</p>
<p>If the players manage to defeat the tree without anyone getting captured, as it’s dying it will direct players to the castle by saying “Guess what, my master will turn your precious bats into meat real soon."</p>
<h2 id="the-mad-factory"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-mad-factory"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Mad Factory</h2>
<p>Conveyor belts are transporting animals and human corpses, bioengineered steampunk machines are processing them, reassembling them into Chimeras.</p>
<img className="frame medium" src="/post/frankensteins-castle/factory.jpg"/>
<p>The animals are taken from the row of cages (bats aren’t in them).</p>
<p>A gigantic eyeball swivels like a snake, standing on its optic nerve, examining the products. Huge tentacles (like a bionic version of Tesla factory robot arms) are dipping animals into a vat of mutagenic goo, and attaching new parts to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a bionic “car” with 6 bear legs in place of its wheels.</li>
<li>A zombie with giant praying mantis legs instead of arms.</li>
<li>A wolf with a human arm in place of the head (think Spot from Boston Dynamics).</li>
<li>Huge dragonflies with buzz saws attached to their tails.</li>
<li>A DeerWolf (think CatDog) with 12 eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahead of the trapped player, a bunny is dipped into the mutagenic goo, comes out with the lower part of its body looking like a huge hairy centipede. The player is next!</p>
<p>After the player has been rescued from the machine, the players see Ivan walk in.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/frankensteins-castle/ivan.png">
<h2 id="ivan"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ivan"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Ivan</h2>
<p>Dr. Grimworks’ assistant. Basically Frankenstein’s monster. Friendly, polite, very sad. Wears a mind-control helmet, forcing him to obey Doctor’s commands.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Ivan will walk up to the animal cages, pick up a huge spider, and start dragging it upstairs - into the tower where Dr’s lab is in. If the players engage with him - he will notice them, act courteous and calm, politely asking them if they’re here for an appointment with Mr. Grimworks.</p>
<h2 id="the-laboratory"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-laboratory"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Laboratory</h2>
<p>Inside the lab, players will see Mr Grimworks.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/frankensteins-castle/waternoose.jpg">
<h2 id="mr-grimworks"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mr-grimworks"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mr Grimworks</h2>
<p>Entrepreneur, mad scientist, Doctor Frankenstein’s distant descendant. Looks like Mr. Waternoose from Monsters Inc.</p>
<p>Doesn’t see himself as evil - he just builds useful tools, makes profits, and doesn’t care too much about the animal suffering he’s causing.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Hanging from the roof of the lab are more animal cages. Among them, Old Drew’s fruit bats!</p>
<p>One of the bats is lying on the gurney, Mr. Grimworks uses the mutagenic sludge to glue huge spider legs to its torso.</p>
<p>When he notices players, he will act cheerful and excited, and launch into a sales pitch “Oh, are you here to place a pre-order on my new, top-of-the-line BatLift 9000? It can deliver even the heaviest objects to the facilities your regular WolfCarrier 500 just can’t reach!”</p>
<h2 id="the-final-showdown"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-final-showdown"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Final Showdown</h2>
<p>Dr. Grimworks won’t be willing to part with the bats without asking an exorbitant price (“they are valuable assets, I can’t just give them away for free, you understand”).</p>
<p>If the players try to rescue the animals by force, the Doctor will weaponize the tool he was using to operate on the bats (picture a steampunk squirt gun), to spray players with the mutagenic sludge.</p>
<img className="frame medium" src="/post/frankensteins-castle/device.jpg"/>
<p>The Doctor is quite agile, he can use his spider legs to run on walls and on the ceiling. Whenever the sludge hits a wall, tentacles erupt from it and try to grasp the players. If it hits a player, a terrible mutation will grow from the player armor or clothes (spider legs, crab claws, scorpion tails, tentacles, extra limbs, etc), and impede the players because of the massive weight on their body.</p>
<p>Some of the random mutations are beneficial - players have control over them and may even use them in combat. Some players might leave this fight with a few extra eyes, a warm wooly coat of fur, or an ability to echolocate.</p>
<p>Ivan will release some of the experimental monsters and they will attack the players. If the players destroy Ivan’s mind-control cap and set him free, he will do his best to help them defeat his evil oppressor. Monsters also have mind-control caps, and can be turned against their creator.</p>
<p>The spider-legged bat is not mind-controlled yet, once released from the gurney it will happily help the players to fight, even let a player jump on its back and fly around the laboratory.</p>
<h2 id="escape-the-crumbling-castle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#escape-the-crumbling-castle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Escape the Crumbling Castle</h2>
<p>Once Dr. Grimworks has been defeated, he will use the last of his strength to open all cages, and activate a dead-man switch, causing the factory tentacles to go haywire and begin destroying everything around them.</p>
<p>The castle, now overrun with monsters and wild animals, begins to collapse. Players can jump onto the backs of the giant bats and fly away to safety. As soon as the bats are free, they will fly back to their master, Old Drew, who will be happy to reunite with his bellowed pets.</p>
<p>If the players have liberated Ivan from his mind-control helmet, and rescued him from the crumbling castle, he will become their loyal friend and ally.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How to create an endless amount of exciting adventure ideas that you and your players can't wait to play with.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my in-depth step-by-step guide to coming up with endless amount of exciting adventure ideas that you and your players can't wait to play with.</p>
<p>Coming up with ideas used to be extremely difficult for me, as I'm not a naturally creative person. But for the past couple of years, I have been running <a href="https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room">adventure brainstorming sessions</a> (a few GMs get on a voice chat and we write an adventure in a couple of hours), we have brainstormed dozens of adventures and playtested/published quite a few. I have learned a lot, and in this post, I will teach you everything I know about creating ideas that are exciting for you and for your players, in a reasonable amount of time, without ever hitting a creative block.</p>
<p>If you're struggling to come up with good ideas, by the end of this guide you will have more ideas than you know what to do with.</p>
<h1 id="start-with-a-clear-goal"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#start-with-a-clear-goal"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Start with a clear goal</h1>
<p>Intentional constraints dramatically simplify the creative process, so the first step is to narrow the infinite space of possible ideas down to something your brain can handle without entering the choice paralysis mode.</p>
<p>The more specific you can get - the better. I recommend that you at least pick a genre and a couple of adjectives describing the kind of adventure you want to create:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lighthearted comedy-heist</li>
<li>Post-apocalyptic fantasy</li>
<li>Intense spy thriller</li>
<li>Gritty western</li>
<li>Sci-fi horror</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-four-components-of-an-idea"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-four-components-of-an-idea"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The four components of an Idea</h1>
<p>A good adventure idea is usually based on one of the following four elements, or an interesting combination of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Important Objective</strong> - an exciting problem that your players will try to solve, the goal they'll try to achieve, or an evil plan they'll try to prevent.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting Setting</strong> - world and locations where the adventure takes place, with a unique twist (unusual location, nature, inhabitants, culture, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Cool Characters</strong> - a cool antagonist the players will have to defeat. With interesting goals, motivations, occupation, appearance, personality, powers, and the problems they're causing. Also, to a lesser extent, some other characters players will meet.</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural Element</strong> - interesting magics, technologies, items, or creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your idea can grow out of any one of these elements. Can you think of an exciting goal, setting, character, or magic you would like to build your story around?</p>
<p>If you aren't sure which one to start with - try making a couple of ideas in each category, and then mixing them together (the ideas should be unrelated to each other, try to make them as different from each other as possible).</p>
<p>Take a look at some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setting + Supernatural</strong>:<br>
A lavish castle where all inhabitants have been mind-controlled by the brain slugs.</li>
<li><strong>Setting + Problem</strong>:<br>
A grotesque experiment has escaped from the mad scientist's laboratory.</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural + Problem</strong>:<br>
A love potion has leaked into the water supply.</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural + Goal</strong>:<br>
You have been hired to obtain a lock of hair from the elusive Sasquatch.</li>
<li><strong>Character + Setting</strong>:<br>
A noble Paladin has arrived at the Pirate City to bring law and order.</li>
<li><strong>Character + Problem</strong>:<br>
A socially awkward prince will lose his claim to the throne unless he finds a wife by next Friday.</li>
<li><strong>Character + Supernatural</strong>:<br>
A pompous King has been turned into a Rat by his evil Vizier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bottom-up-ideas"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#bottom-up-ideas"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Bottom-Up ideas</h3>
<p>If you have an idea for some very specific part of the story (you want your players to fight a certain monster, visit a certain location, find a specific magical artifact, etc.) - you can grow a story around that. Expand the idea and see if it leads you to one or few of the core components I've outlined above.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I want my players to attend the King's feast:
<ul>
<li>Problem: They learn that someone has poisoned the food.</li>
<li>Supernatural: The cooked boar has left a ghost who is determined to ruin the feast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have a cool swamp battle-map:
<ul>
<li>Setting: The Swamplands of No Return.</li>
<li>Character: Swamp Witch who holds a Terrible Secret.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I want my players to find the Scroll of Sweet Slithering Snakes:
<ul>
<li>Character: It is being held by a brilliant, powerful, and extremely paranoid wizard.</li>
<li>Setting: It has been lost in the Basilisk's lair.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="blank-page-vs-lego-blocks"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#blank-page-vs-lego-blocks"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Blank Page vs Lego Blocks</h1>
<p>It is difficult and unnecessary to try to invent everything from scratch, just by staring at the blank page and trying to make something up by thinking really hard. I struggled with this a lot, it was one of the main causes of my writer's block.</p>
<p>Instead of staring into the emptiness of a blank page, creativity should feel like playing with lego blocks. You take existing ideas and tropes you're already familiar with, and try to recombine them in new ways, or change them and turn them into something new.</p>
<h3 id="picking-apart-stories"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#picking-apart-stories"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Picking Apart Stories</h3>
<p>You obtain the lego blocks to play with by picking apart your favorite stories - movies, TV shows, books, games, comics, and so on.</p>
<p>Look through the list of interesting stories, and extract the idea components out of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did the main character want in this story, is there an interesting problem they were trying to solve?</li>
<li>Does the story take place in an interesting setting?</li>
<li>What are some of the coolest, most memorable characters that you've seen in this story?</li>
<li>Does the story explore some interesting magics or technologies, does it involve some supernatural creatures?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all stories will have all the four elements, but in most of them at least one of these components is really strong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve a murder despite memory loss (Memento)</li>
<li>Diffuse the bomb before the bus stops moving (Speed)</li>
<li>Defeat a skyscraper full of terrorists by yourself (Die Hard)</li>
<li>Teach a young girl to kill so she could avenge her family (Leon)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Setting</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hogwarts</li>
<li>The Matrix</li>
<li>Wasteland (Fallout)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Character</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Walter White</li>
<li>Jack Sparrow</li>
<li>Indiana Jones</li>
<li>Ace Ventura</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supernatural</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Time Loop (Groundhog Day)</li>
<li>Sentient Toys (Toy Story)</li>
<li>Body Switching (Freaky Friday)</li>
<li>Mech Suit (Iron Man)</li>
</ul>
<p>or a combination of these components is really interesting or unexpected:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shared dreams + Heist = Inception</li>
<li>Romeo and Juliet + RMS Titanic = Titanic</li>
<li>Bank Heist + Zombies = Army of The Dead</li>
<li>Time travel + Undo the Butterfly Effect = Back to the Future</li>
<li>Sentient Animals + Avenge your Father = Lion King</li>
<li>Time Travel + Robot Rebellion = Terminator</li>
<li>Escape from Monster + Xenomorph = Alien</li>
<li>Timid teacher + Become a Crime Lord = Breaking Bad</li>
</ul>
<p>Build a library of these elements. Many storytellers keep this library in their heads, but I recommend using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgasFqcKVG0f0jOwBRaHYO6dYRSkgdx-UgtXXk3ictI/">this google docs template</a> to create a digital library of ideas.</p>
<p>Start collecting ideas. Whenever you see a movie/book/game that you enjoy, extract the ideas you liked the most, and add them to your collection.</p>
<p>This library is like a big box of lego blocks - when it's time to create an adventure, you can use them to assemble a new and interesting combination of ideas that you haven't seen before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, let's take a few elements from the lists above and recombine them into something new:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Romeo and Juliet + Bank Heist</strong><br>
A love-struck teenager asks the players to help him commit a bank heist to impress the father of the girl he's in love with, a crime boss of a powerful mafia family.</li>
<li><strong>Sentient Animals + Ace Ventura</strong><br>
A crazy druid with the personality of Ace Ventura leads his army of sentient flying squirrels to take revenge on the lumberjack village that's destroying his forest.</li>
<li><strong>Robot Rebellion + Hogwarts</strong><br>
The animated suits of armor and the stone gargoyles have been hijacked by unknown magic and are wrecking havoc on a magic castle. The players must rescue the royal family from the castle that came alive.</li>
<li><strong>Titanic + Zombies</strong><br>
A zombie outbreak on the ship leads to a catastrophe, players must survive on a sinking ship full of zombies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to realize that there's already an endless amount of creative ideas out there, made for you by thousands of storytellers, and these ideas are already good (since they're taken from the stories you like). You can just take the good ideas out of context, and make them different and unique by changing the genre, details, and combining them with other creative ideas in new ways. Then all you have to do is to assemble all these new ideas into a story that makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="adapting-stories"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#adapting-stories"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Adapting Stories</h3>
<p>The easiest way to come up with an adventure idea is to just adapt one of your favorite stories, changing only a few details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alien in a Fantasy world</strong><br>
Stop the cruel power-hungry emperor who tries to build himself an army by breeding dangerous Xenomorph-like monsters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Die Hard in a Magic Castle</strong><br>
Vampires took over the magic school, you're the only ones who can rescue their hostages before they get turned into vampires.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Honey I Shrunk The Kids</strong><br>
Evil witch poisons the players with a shrinking potion, they must escape and travel through her (now enormous) magic hut to the top shelf where the enlargement potion is stored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way to make such adventures more original is to adapt ideas from different genres and mediums. If you're writing a fantasy adventure - adapt an idea from your favorite Sci-Fi TV show (like Rick and Morty or Firefly), from a game (like Last of Us), or a musical (like Nightmare Time by Starkid).</p>
<h3 id="recombining-the-elements"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#recombining-the-elements"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Recombining the Elements</h3>
<p>Combine two interesting ideas together to create something new, mix and match the tropes, putting them together in different ways (like playing with lego blocks):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sentient Animals + Lord of the Rings</strong><br>
Players play as mice who have stumbled upon The One Ring, and are now humanity's last hope.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rescue Mission + Scary Monster</strong><br>
The players are hired by a cooky wizard to find and return his runaway pet. His pet is a zombie chimera made out of fury and rage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pirates + Floating Islands</strong><br>
Defend a floating pirate town (think Tortuga) being attacked by a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the individual ideas don't have to be that interesting or original - you can just lift them from other stories, which is very easy to do. The unique combination of two simple ideas is what makes your story creative, unique, and original.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-elements"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#changing-the-elements"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Changing the Elements</h3>
<p>Another way to build on top of the ideas and make them more original is to change them in interesting ways.</p>
<p>To change an idea, you need to take one of its key elements and reverse it (do the opposite), exaggerate it (take it to the extreme), or replace it with an entirely different element (idea from a completely different story or genre).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reverse the Goal: Rescue the Dragon from the Princess</strong><br>
A cruel princess has kidnapped the baby dragon's mom, and is forcing her to fight in a coliseum. Help to rescue the big mama dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reverse the Key Character Trait: Evil Batman</strong><br>
Protect the city from a ruthless high-tech vigilante driven by his misguided code of honor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Change the Setting: Typical Train Heist story, set on a Zeppelin</strong><br>
Rescue an innocent person being delivered by Zeppelin to serve her life sentence in prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exaggerate the Supernatural Element</strong><br>
Solve the disappearance of cows in a village where <strong>everyone</strong> is secretly a werewolf.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="combining-your-own-ideas"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#combining-your-own-ideas"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Combining Your Own Ideas</h2>
<p>Make a list of 5-10 ideas using the methods above, and then combine/reverse/exaggerate some of <em>these</em> ideas to make something even more unique and interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zombies on the Titanic + Ace Ventura</strong><br>
The zombies have been released by a crazy zombie-rights activist who has steered the ship into the island where he's planning to build his own zombie utopia.</li>
<li><strong>Runaway Chimera + Pirates of the Floating Island</strong><br>
Players must protect the escaped gargoyle (a protected species) from the crew of flying pirates who are determined to capture it.</li>
<li><strong>Shrinking Potion + The King's Feast</strong><br>
King's enemies have added the shrinking potion into wine, and now players must help the king to fight off the rebellion despite being the size of an ant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-images-and-adventure-prompts"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#using-images-and-adventure-prompts"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Using Images and Adventure Prompts</h2>
<p>Just like extracting ideas from books and movies, you can extract them from artworks, which are a goldmine of useful ideas. <a href="https://www.artstation.com/">ArtStation</a> has a lot of beautiful artworks, and the functionality that allows you to categorize them and build collections. You can install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artstation-discover/ghkbedmkakkdhfkhchadmkhlflnafocm?hl=en">extension</a> that randomly shows you a new artwork every time you open a new tab in the browser. Add the most inspiring images to your collection, and then use them as prompts to come up with ideas.</p>
<p>I have already built a pretty big collection of cool ideas, and created a tool that recombines them for you automatically. Try using the <a href="https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts">Adventure Prompts Tool</a> - generate random prompts and try to pitch a few ideas based on the combinations of these elements.</p>
<p>I recommend setting a 2-minute timer, and challenging yourself to pitch a story idea based on whatever random prompts you end up with. These pitches often end up surprisingly interesting and creative, and in 20 minutes you can create 10 such pitches you can add to your list of ideas.</p>
<p>It is much easier and more fun to do this together with a friend - take turns generating prompts and pitching ideas, then build on top of each other's ideas using the methods described above.</p>
<h2 id="more-good-sources-of-story-ideas"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#more-good-sources-of-story-ideas"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>More Good Sources of Story Ideas</h2>
<p>Aside from passively collecting ideas from the movies you're watching and the books you're reading, you can actively research ideas. Browse the lists of stories until you find an element that gets you excited, and build an adventure around it.</p>

<h1 id="primary-objective"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#primary-objective"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Primary Objective</h1>
<p>Your adventure idea isn't complete until you have figured out the Primary Objective your players will try to pursue - a <strong>Problem</strong> they will be trying to solve or a <strong>Goal</strong> they will be trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>The Primary Objective is the <strong>core of your story</strong>, the most important element you need to figure out. Once you know the Objective - everything else will fall into place, because almost all the other elements of the adventure are defined in relation to the Objective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adventure Hook</strong> is the moment at the beginning of the adventure where the players encounter the Problem they must solve or establish the Goal they will try to achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Antagonist</strong> is the primary force that stands in the way of the players, their goal is the opposite of the heroes' Objective.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Encounters</strong> are the obstacles that the players will need to overcome on their path to the Objective.</li>
<li><strong>Intriguing Mysteries</strong> are bits and pieces of information the players will gather throughout their adventure that are required for them to accomplish their goal.</li>
<li><strong>Surprising Twist</strong> is the moment in the middle of the adventure when the players' Objective changes in some way - they realize that it's not what they once thought it was, or some complication makes it much more difficult to achieve.</li>
<li><strong>The Climax</strong> of the adventure is the moment when the Objective is resolved, when the players succeed at accomplishing their goal (or, rarely, fail to do so and lose).</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolving the Objective will be the single most important event in the story, it will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the "final battle" revolves around.</p>
<h2 id="stories-are-about-problem-solving"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#stories-are-about-problem-solving"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Stories are about Problem Solving</h2>
<p>Stories and roleplaying games are fundamentally about creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>Adventure Ideas are fundamentally problems. They create an exciting, challenging, important goal for the players to accomplish.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental "game loop" of an RPG - the GM puts an interesting problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it.</p>
<p>Big problems are broken down into smaller Challenges. In every scene the characters try to solve a small problem, their successes take them closer to achieving their goal, the setbacks and complications take them farther away from that goal.</p>
<p>Players encounter a big problem at the beginning of the story, they go through a series of challenges that add up to ultimately solving the problem at the Climax of the story.</p>
<p>This gives the players a sense of progress, makes them feel like their actions are meaningful, make an impact on the world, add up to some larger purpose. The Primary Objective is that purpose.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-primary-objective"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-makes-a-good-primary-objective"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What makes a Good Primary Objective</h2>
<p>The Primary Objective is a <strong>specific thing the players must do</strong> in order to succeed in their quest. A specific action they must take that will resolve the main conflict.</p>
<p>Primary Objective must be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Stakes</strong> - players should care about accomplishing it. It should be very meaningful and important to the characters and to the world they live in. Players should have a good reason to pursue it, whatever it takes.</li>
<li><strong>Exciting</strong> - the problem should be interesting to solve, the goal should be desirable to achieve. Players will spend the whole adventure doing everything in their power to accomplish this, so it should be something fun to participate in.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult</strong> - the objective should be difficult to accomplish. It will be the main source of challenges and conflict in your story, it will create a lot of struggle for the characters, and you want your players to feel epic and heroic when they succeed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Objective Examples</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Kill the dragon to save the village.</li>
<li>Break out an innocent from an unassailable prison.</li>
<li>Stop the Villain from opening a portal into the Demon Dimension.</li>
<li>Solve the crime to prevent a war between the two kingdoms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives-and-villains"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#objectives-and-villains"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Objectives and Villains</h2>
<p>Objectives come in two types, like two sides of the same coin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Players really want something, and the villain stands in their way.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rescue a princess from a dragon.</li>
<li>Journey to a distant location and find treasure.</li>
<li>Broker peace between warring kingdoms.</li>
<li>Perform the heist of the century.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Villain really wants something, and players must do whatever it takes to stop them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prevent the villain from performing a terrible world-ending ritual.</li>
<li>Make sure the villain won't get their hands on a powerful artifact.</li>
<li>The Villain wants to kill or kidnap someone, and the players must protect them.</li>
<li>The Villain is pursuing the players, and they must escape to survive.</li>
</ul>
<p>So any idea you have for an Objective is actually two ideas - it is either something the players want to pursue ("Kill a Terrible Monster"), or must prevent the villain from obtaining ("Protect an Adorable Creature from the evil Hunter.").</p>
<p>Looking at the Objectives this way doubles the amount of ideas you have, and helps you to come up with interesting and unusual stories (by swapping the Heroes and the Villains, telling the story from the perspective of the Antagonist).</p>
<h2 id="objective-archetypes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#objective-archetypes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Objective Archetypes</h2>
<p>Just as described above, taking ideas from your favorite stories (and changing them a bit) is one of the best ways to come up with your objective.</p>
<p>Unlike the other story elements, the objectives actually tend to be pretty generic - there's a limited amount of story archetypes (the goals the heroes can pursue). There are about 10-20 most common objectives that 90% of the stories revolve around. What makes an objective unique is the specifics of the story, all the other elements of the adventure idea that surround the objective.</p>
<p>When you watch movies and read stories, learn to notice the objective the heroes are trying to pursue, and compile a list of your favorite ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some of the most common objectives:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining some important item (McGuffin), creature, person, or information.<br>
(Train robberies, fetch quests, rescue missions, spy missions, capturing fugitives.)</li>
<li>Killing/defeating a Villain or a dangerous monster who's up to no good.<br>
(Horror movies, superhero movies, many sci-fi and fantasy movies.)</li>
<li>Traveling to some distant location through dangerous territory, or ending up in a dangerous place and trying to survive and return home.<br>
(Most adventure stories).</li>
<li>Solving mysteries, finding out the truth.<br>
(Most detective and mystery stories).</li>
<li>Invading, Defending, or Escaping a location.<br>
(Heists, prison breaks, many action movies).</li>
<li>Convincing/manipulating people, gaining power through non-violent means.<br>
(Intrigue, drama).</li>
</ul>
<p>(or preventing a villain from doing one of the above).</p>
<p><a href="https://rpgadventures.io/files/objective-archetypes.pdf">Here</a> you can see the full list of the objectives I have compiled. You can go through the list and try applying each of the ideas to your premise, that is a sure way to generate a lot of new and interesting story ideas.</p>
<h2 id="premise-based-objectives"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#premise-based-objectives"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Premise-Based Objectives</h2>
<p>Very often the objective will grow naturally out of the story idea you have developed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with a Villain</strong> - come up with an idea for a villain, and figure out what it is that they want that the heroes must try to prevent.</li>
<li><strong>Start with the Setting</strong> - what's wrong with the world the heroes are living in, what must be fixed?</li>
<li><strong>Start with the Supernatural Element</strong> - some kind of magic, spell, technology, or a creature is causing problems, and the story is about resolving those problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time when you have any idea, it's possible to figure out what kind of Objective it naturally leads to. Is that something heroes want? Is that something they fear? Is it causing some problems they must solve?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Villain - Crazy scientist obsessed with world domination.<br>
Objective - stop him from performing his dangerous experiment.</li>
<li>Setting - a dystopian world where the good has won, and is now ruthlessly oppressing the evil.<br>
Objective - incite the monster rebellion and lead it against the Paladin army.</li>
<li>Supernatural Element - a magic Trident used to control the Kraken.<br>
Objective - steal it from the Pirate Lord who's currently using it to control the seas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="difficulties"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#difficulties"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Difficulties</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to make the Objective more interesting is to add some restriction to it that makes it more difficult:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Problem must be solved using social/political means only.</li>
<li>Problem must be solved stealthily, secretly, undercover.</li>
<li>Problem must be solved under time pressure.</li>
<li>Players must avoid violence, collateral damage.</li>
<li>Players must compete with the rivals.</li>
<li>Players must cooperate with the enemy.</li>
<li>Players have incomplete/false information.</li>
<li>Players have limited resources/preparation.</li>
<li>Players must do it while protecting someone.</li>
<li>Players must do it under scrutiny/supervision, bound by strict rules/laws.</li>
<li>Target must be unharmed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="developing-your-ideas"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#developing-your-ideas"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Developing your Ideas</h2>
<p>Now you have countless ways of finding adventure ideas, and strategies to create infinite combinations of them. You know how to come up with an exciting premise for your story, and an objective for your players to accomplish, which makes the process of creating the rest of the adventure very straightforward and easy.</p>
<p>The next step is to make a list of 5-10 ideas, pick your favorite one, and develop it into a story. To do that, you can use the <a href="https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template">brainstorming template</a> - it will guide you through the process of turning your idea into a story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#summary"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>The players are shipwrecked on the shores of Isla Exilia - the dreaded trash island where the most ruthless of criminals are sent to live out their life sentences.</p>
<p>Prisoners capture the players and attempt to use them in a sacrificial ritual designed to stop the Leviathan from destroying the island.</p>
<p>The players must survive, evade a pack of trained sharks, race against the prisoners (led by the cruel half-man half-shark - Captain Bluto) to the top of a derelict Galleon (vertically stuck on its end, like sinking Titanic), and harness the Roc (an enormous bird) perched at the top - their only chance to escape and fly away to freedom.</p>

<h2 id="setting"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#setting"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Setting</h2>
<p>Out in the Sargasso sea, lies Isla Exilia - a twisted mess of shipwrecks, debris, and rotting carcasses of sea creatures. Any lost ship that gets caught by the currents will eventually end up in this doomed place.</p>
<img className="frame medium" src="/post/sink-or-soar/trash-island-cropped.png"/>
<p>Those on land know that the fate of rudderless ships is to end up crashing on Isla Exilia, and purposely maroon their worst criminals by setting them adrift on a sabotaged, old derelict ship ready to be sunk.</p>
<p>The prisoners lucky enough to be thrown on the shores of Isla Exhilia before their ship falls apart have made a society for themselves, dwelling inside the wrecked ships and surviving off the bounty of the ocean.</p>
<p>In the middle of the island is Poseidon’s Wrath - an enormous Galleon set on its rear. It looms over the island like the leaning tower of Pisa (think the Titanic just before it sinks).</p>
<p>Once per year, a migrating Roc takes a brief rest on top of this ship. There are tales of foolhardy prisoners who managed to make the climb to the top, harness the Roc, and fly away to freedom.</p>
<p>Each time the Roc arrives (the day known as The Coming of The Roc), the Leviathan rises from the depths of the sea and rears its head, preparing to strike. The legends say that the Leviathan has been hunting the Roc for thousands of years, and human sacrifice is the only way to appease its hunger, prevent it from attacking the Roc, and destroying the island.</p>
<h2 id="shipwrecked"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#shipwrecked"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Shipwrecked</h2>
<p>The players begin their adventure sailing a small ship hopelessly caught by the strong currents, accelerating towards the shores of Isla Exilia until it hits some large underwater object and falls apart.</p>
<p>They must survive the shipwreck, avoid hungry sharks circling them,  and swim towards the shore - a stinking mound of debris, kelp, hulls of broken ships, and rotting carcasses of sea creatures.</p>
<p>The most perceptive players will notice faint shadows of enormous tentacles looming in the murky waters - the cause of their crash.</p>
<img className="frame" src="/post/sink-or-soar/leviathan.jpg"/>
<h2 id="the-doomed-place"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-doomed-place"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Doomed Place</h2>
<p>Once the players arrive, they are surrounded by the prisoners, who seem to be in surprisingly good spirits. Prisoners are led by Captain Bluto, who commands to apprehend the new arrivals and take them to The Ring to “participate in the Festival”.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/sink-or-soar/king-shark-1.jpg">
<h2 id="captain-bluto"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#captain-bluto"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Captain Bluto</h2>
<p>Captain Bluto, the leader of the prisoners, half-person half-shark (think King Shark from The Suicide Squad). Ruthless, ambitious, determined to escape the island at any cost.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>The players are captured, restrained, and escorted to the circle of ships in the distance.</p>
<p>While the party is being escorted, a peculiar prisoner approaches them and goes on about random bird facts.</p>
<CharacterBox  src="/post/sink-or-soar/skrank.jpg">
<h2 id="skrank"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#skrank"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Skrank</h2>
<p>Crazy, old bird enthusiast. He loves the Isla Exilia for all of the sea birds it attracts, and is obsessed with researching the Roc. He is missing a leg that he lost to one of the sharks.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>He seems easy to dismiss as crazy, but he’s happy to share what he knows about the island and its history.</p>
<p>He tells them that if they survive the Festival (the sacrificial ritual to placate the Leviathan), they might have a chance of escaping this place. He offers his help in exchange for helping him to get to the Roc he wishes to fly on.</p>
<h2 id="the-ring-of-blood"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-ring-of-blood"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Ring of Blood</h2>
<p>Players are escorted inside the circle of ships, which surround a large space of open water, where people are fishing, washing clothes, drying fish - The Ring is the center of this society and provides everything the prisoners need to continue their survival.</p>
<p>They watch as Captain Bluto summons a Pack of Wily Sharks, who take fish from his hand and  answer to him like a pack of vicious dogs.</p>
<CharacterBox>
<h2 id="the-shark-pack"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-shark-pack"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Shark Pack</h2>
<p>This pack of sharks is intelligent like wolves and hunts as a pack. They are menace that keep the party moving and will take advantage of any moment to strike from the water.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>He welcomes everyone to the Coming of the Roc Festival and informs them that this is the year he will get off this pile of rotten garbage. He shows everyone a hook and rope harness and is answered by cheers. He tells people to bring the offering of the prisoners so that the Leviathan will stay sated.</p>
<img className="frame" src="/post/sink-or-soar/walk-the-plank.jpg"/>
<p>Players watch as the first group of forlorn looking prisoners is being marched to the plank.</p>
<p>As the first prisoner is pushed off the plank, a huge tentacle rises up from the water, slices him in half mid-air, and drags him into the ocean. More prisoners begin to drop off the plank into the increasingly red waters below. The players are next.</p>
<p>If the players manage to escape, Captain Bluto will shout “What are you doing!? You will bring the creature down upon us all!!”</p>
<p>When the ritual is interrupted, the Leviathan becomes enraged and begins lashing out at the island around it. All prisoners rush towards Poseidon's Wrath, which is now their only chance to survive and escape from the progressively decimated island.</p>
<p>The players will notice a rope dropped down from the crow’s nest that hangs crookedly above the pool - Skrank offering them a way out of the whirlpool of blood and angry tentacles.</p>
<h2 id="the-crows-nest"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-crows-nest"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Crow’s Nest</h2>
<p>From Crow’s Nest players will see everyone rushing towards Poseidon’s Wrath towering in the distance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Atop the Poseidon’s Wrath is the Roc’s perch! We must hurry if we are to catch it before the others do!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skrank will give the players a rope harness and a grappling hook explaining this is a one-way ticket off the island and motion with the hook that they can use to harness the bird and fly away attached to it by rope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a shortcut to the Poseidon’s Wrath, across the Flotsam Bridge but it will not be easy, especially for an old man with one leg!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The players must figure out how to get to the Flotsam Bridge in a hurry. They can use ropes to make a zipline, fashion a large sheet of sails into a hang glider, cut down the crow’s nest causing it to topple, or find some other way down.</p>
<h2 id="the-flotsam-bridge"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-flotsam-bridge"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Flotsam Bridge</h2>
<img className="frame" src="/post/sink-or-soar/sakaar-1.png"/>
<p>The “Flotsam Bridge” is the unstable part of the island, a field of floating garbage with a few large chunks of floating debris.</p>
<p>The players see prisoners running through the field, using hooks and ropes to jump from one floating pile of junk to the next. They will see a prisoner make a jump for it, only to get snatched mid-air by a shark leaping out of the water. This is going to be dangerous!</p>
<p>The sharks circling below wait for those who fall in the water to become their lunch, prisoners try to push each other and the party into water as they scramble towards the Poseidon’s Wrath.</p>
<h2 id="the-poseidons-wrath"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-poseidons-wrath"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Poseidon’s Wrath</h2>
<p>The Roc’s nest is on the very top of the ship, nearly two hundred feet in the air. If the Skrank is still alive, his one leg is going to make this climb difficult. There are holes and rotting wood everywhere. The players may choose to enter the ship or climb the hull from the outside. There are prisoners who are hastily making the climb as well, desperate to be the first to get to the Roc and fly away with him.</p>
<p>The massive weight of the Roc landing on the ship makes it creak, groan, crack and break in places. As they rush to the top, the rotting timbers of the boat will break under their feet, and the tentacles emerging from below may grab them and pull them close to the edge.</p>
<h2 id="the-roc-and-the-wet-place"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-roc-and-the-wet-place"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Roc And The Wet Place</h2>
<p>Once the Players emerge at the top of the Poseidon’s Wrath, the immense sense of the Roc is stunning. This bird could fly away with a couple elephants in its talons. The only prisoners who make it to the top are Captain Bluto and his cronies. All the others are either behind or have fallen.</p>
<img className="frame" src="/post/sink-or-soar/roc.jpg"/>
<p>There is a dangerous fight at the top of the ship while in the shadow of the resting Roc, who plays no mind to the little fighters below him. Just then, at the height of the battle, the players and Bluto lose their footing, the boat shakes and to their horror, massive tentacles arise out of the debris and begin to swipe at the Roc, ripping Poseidon's Wrath to pieces! As it begins to collapse on itself the climbing prisoners scramble and fall.</p>
<p>The Roc takes flight, Bluto and any prisoners still alive throw their hooks onto the bird and are yanked off the collapsing boat. The Players either need to throw their hook and latch onto the Roc or hang onto one of the prisoners who are  hooked.</p>
<p>As the Roc flees the party sees the Leviathan destroy Poseidon's Wrath and break the island around it into small pieces.</p>
<p>The climax fight takes place on the ropes flying in the wind, attached to a flying Roc. Bluto and his prisoners will try to cut the ropes that the players are clinging to with their lives. Any fall from here down into the sea would be a certain death.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resolution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>The Roc is much too large to notice anything hooked onto him, but if the fight turns too intense and bothersome, he might ruffle his feathers.</p>
<p>The Roc, players, and the surviving prisoners fly into the sunset and onto the next adventure. If Skrank is still alive he’s beaming with happiness, rattling off Roc facts, and planning to fly with him until he lands.</p>
<p>Further Adventures await!</p>
<p>Roll credits (or perchaps, Roc credits?).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#summary"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>The Emperor and many warriors of an Aztec Tribe have been turned into the Ghouls after they drank potions made by the evil Witch Doctor (Mundungu). The players must investigate the local black market, figure out what's going on, and travel to the lost ancient pyramid where they can brew the antidote (if they can defeat the Mundungu and his ghoul army).</p>

<h2 id="ghoulish-affair"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ghoulish-affair"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Ghoulish Affair</h2>
<p><img src="/post/golly-gosh-ghouls/aztec-city.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Players arrive at the City of Suns following the rumors about the legendary fountain of youth. The city is in chaos - their Emperor and many great warriors have been turned into ghouls.</p>
<p>At the palace the players meet the 11 year old prince (who has been running the city for the past few days) and the Emperor - a horrible ghoul chained to his throne.</p>
<p>Talking to the prince reveals that before his transformation, the Emperor went somewhere with a shady hulking figure. On their way out of the throne room the players notice the described figure lurking in the shadows.</p>
<h2 id="follow-the-fores"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#follow-the-fores"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Follow the For’es</h2>
<p>The burly figure belongs to Buh’rute For’es - Mundungu’s minion, sent there to keep an eye on the Emperor. The players can track him to the black market. If he spots them, he can be fooled - he’s not the brightest, but is very loyal to his boss, and very strong (think Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove).</p>
<h2 id="at-the-black-market"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#at-the-black-market"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>At the Black Market</h2>
<p>Players investigate the black market and interrogate the various vendors. There are rumors that a local shaman has been selling new vitality potions, claiming that they grant unparalleled strength and stamina.</p>
<p><img src="/post/golly-gosh-ghouls/black-market.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The owner of an exotic pet shop will demand that players buy one of his terrible creatures (dogfish, a snake with arms, a reverse griffon, etc) before he will point the players in the direction of the apothecary, where the shaman conducts his business.</p>
<h2 id="perilous-potions-peddler"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#perilous-potions-peddler"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Perilous Potions Peddler</h2>
<p>The players will find themselves at a rundown apothecary, a home to the creepy shaman. He is a cowardly old man who Mundungu was using as a stooge to peddle his potions. The players can persuade or intimidate him to help. He will tell players about Mundungu and the ancient Aztec Temple where he’s using the Cursed Fountain to make potions (which can also be used to create antidotes).</p>
<h2 id="through-the-jungle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#through-the-jungle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Through the Jungle</h2>
<p>On their way to the Temple the players will have to make their way through the jungle. They will encounter sentient carnivorous plants, lights that are trying to lure adventurers into the swamp, and a flesh-craving tree-octopus that can disguise itself like a chameleon.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-temple-of-doom"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#into-the-temple-of-doom"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Into the Temple of Doom</h2>
<p><img src="/post/golly-gosh-ghouls/temple.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the players enter the temple of doom they will have to navigate through the various traps. These traps can include a snake pit, a giant boulder, and a pressure plate triggering darts. Once they have survived or disabled these traps, they will reach the Cursed Fountain in the middle of the pyramid.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-cursed-fountain"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#at-the-cursed-fountain"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>At the Cursed Fountain</h2>
<p>Mundungu and his army of ghouls are busy using the fountain to produce the potions.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/golly-gosh-ghouls/dr-facilier.jpg" frame>
<h2 id="mundungu"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mundungu"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mundungu</h2>
<p>Voodoo Witch Doctor wearing a spiffy tophat. Discovered the Cursed Fountain and used it to brew the potions that turn people into ghouls he can control. Dreams of taking over the City of Suns and becoming the next Emperor.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Mundungu controls the temple using a golden idol he’s hiding in his tophat, and can use the temple's defenses (wines, wall-mounted darts, floor pits) as his weapons. The players have to defeat him and his ghouls (without killing them, since they’re innocent victims), and gain control of the fountain which they can use to brew the antidote.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resolution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>Once cured, the Emperor will be eternally grateful and offer the players some treasure as a reward and tell them they are forever welcome in the city. The Fountain curse can be lifted so it can be used to produce health potions, or it can stay cursed and produce bioweapons.</p>

<p>Players are Pirates of the Floating Islands, and their home, Fera Ley (think Tortuga but in the air) is being attacked by the HMAS Valiant - a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”.</p>
<p>The Dread Pirate Mont Blanc was just defeated in battle by HMAS Valiant, and now the players are Fera Ley’s last hope to keep her freedom.</p>

<h2 id="mont-blancs-battle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mont-blancs-battle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mont Blanc’s Battle</h2>
<p>The party meets up in the Buccaneer's Arms (the local Tavern). The Mayor of Fera Ley, a portly fellow named Richard Dullen runs into the tavern gasping and panting. “Mont Blanc has been defeated!” Everyone leaves the tavern and can see in the skies just off the island the end of a battle and Mont Blanc’s ship, the Stuart’s Satisfaction, going down in flames as boarding lines are being cut.</p>
<h2 id="pirates-and-parrots"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pirates-and-parrots"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Pirates and Parrots</h2>
<p>In the crowd, they meet Giotto Turtleton:</p>
<CharacterBox>
<h2 id="giotto-turtleton"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#giotto-turtleton"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Giotto Turtleton</h2>
<p>Anthropomorphic Turtle wearing a spiffy hat. An extremely grumpy, old, cunning,  and experienced pirate-alchemist.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Their only chance at saving the island is to sneak on board of Valiant, rescue Mont Blanc, and capture the ship to make it a part of the pirate fleet.</p>
<p>Giotto gives players the shrinking potions, which enable them to shrink to roughly 3 inches tall, and, under the cover of night, fly their parrots to Valiant. Along the way they are attacked by a hungry osprey, and must defend themselves and their parrots.</p>
<h2 id="infiltration"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#infiltration"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Infiltration</h2>
<p>The pirates land on the ship and revert to their normal size. They have to dodge or confront the marines aboard the ship, and encounter the Quartermaster, Victor Van Boom. Victor is crooked, and can be bribed (or threatened) to show the party the way to Mont Blanc and his crew in the jail cell.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#jailbreak"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Jailbreak</h2>
<p>Mont Blanc and the crew are in jail. The lock can be picked, or Victor can unlock the door. Their weapons are in the weaponry nearby, guarded by two paladins. Once the pirates are out, they will help the party to take over the ship. Meanwhile, Valiant is close enough to the island to attack.</p>
<p><img src="/post/pirates-and-parrots/pirates-and-parrots.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On their way to the captain’s cabin, the pirates must bypass the squadron of Navy soldiers. They can cause a distraction, or stealth their way through by crawling on the outside of the ship’s hull.</p>
<h2 id="angel-of-death"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#angel-of-death"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Angel of Death</h2>
<p>In the middle of the ship there’s a captain’s cabin.</p>
<CharacterBox>
<h2 id="viva-morrow-the-angel-of-death"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#viva-morrow-the-angel-of-death"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Viva Morrow, the Angel of Death</h2>
<p>Captain of the Valiant. Can be played as a paladin or equivalent. Has Iron Wings that deploy to fly her to safety in the event of going overboard.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Once the pirates get too close, Captain Morrow steers the ship in the direction of Fera Ley and then breaks the navigational system. As the players fight her and her crew, they must fix the ship before it crashes into the island, killing everyone in town and on board. The captain’s cabin contains the engineering blueprints which can be used to fix the ship, if players can get past Viva and her fierce attacks.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resolution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>The Empire is repelled, Fera Ley’s freedom is restored. Now, with HMAS Valiant in their navy, they’re able to defend themselves against the Empire. The age of pirates continues. For now...</p>

<p>A war-torn kingdom next to the Evil Empire which is gradually corrupting the world around it with its darkness.</p>
<p><strong>The Prancing Pony</strong> - starting tavern, where the mice encounter the human adventurers and the cat. A mouse village is in its basement.</p>
<p><strong>The Dark Citadel</strong> towering over the lands surrounding the Evil Empire (think Mordor).</p>
<h2 id="meeting-cataclysm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#meeting-cataclysm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meeting Cataclysm</h2>
<p>Players see the party of human adventurers in the Prancing Pony, and overhear them talking about destroying the Dark Lord. They also see a cat hiding in the shadows, glaring at the human party with unsettling red eyes.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/merry-mice-of-mordor/cataclysm.png">
<h2 id="cataclysm-the-insatiable"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#cataclysm-the-insatiable"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Cataclysm the Insatiable</h2>
<p>Evil Cat with the personality of  a James Bond villain. Wears a collar with a pendant in the shape of Evil Eye, which is the Dark Lord’s Last Horcrux.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Once he notices that mice spotted him, he destroys their village and kidnaps some adorable mouse NPCs. Now he’s running towards the Dark Woods, and the party must brave the Dark Forest and the evils beyond to save their friends.</p>
<h2 id="through-the-battle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#through-the-battle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Through the Battle</h2>
<p>On their way to the Dark Citadel, players make their way through the war-torn country. Their city is under siege, and in order to reach the Dark Forest that stands between them  and Mordor, they must navigate through the battle between Men and Orc armies, dashing between the soldiers.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-forest"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-dark-forest"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Dark Forest</h2>
<p>The Dark Forest is scary and full of foes. The party is spied on by Vampire Bats, and they encounter Pot Bellied War Pigs, and must stealth, fight, bluff, or bargain their way past.</p>
<p>They encounter Lady Gwendolyn, a giant spider who is weeping at her web, mourning her spider-babies who were lost to Cataclysm. She is a great seeress, and reveals to them that the collar of Cataclysm is the last Horcrux of the Dark Lord. Until it is destroyed, he cannot be killed.</p>
<h2 id="infiltrating-the-castle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#infiltrating-the-castle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Infiltrating the Castle</h2>
<p>To make their way into the castle the players must find a way to cross a lava moat. There is a secret door they can find, the main gates are guarded by gullible orcs.</p>
<p>They make their way up the floors of the Dark Citadel through scary corridors filled with traps, where they can meet the animated suits of armor, orcs playing cards, living portraits, and a poltergeist.</p>
<h2 id="luring-away-the-cat"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#luring-away-the-cat"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Luring Away the Cat</h2>
<p>The players sneak into the castle and end up in the kitchen, where they have to dodge chefs with knives and avoid mouse traps. In the spice cupboard, there’s a bag of catnip, Cataclysm’s secret stash, which they can use to lure Cataclysm away from the Dark Lord.</p>
<h2 id="battle-atop-the-dark-tower"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#battle-atop-the-dark-tower"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Battle Atop the Dark Tower</h2>
<p>The throne room is on the highest floor of the Dark Tower. Cataclysm is laying on the Dark Lord’s lap, purring. He must be lured away from his master’s protection to be defeated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a stunning view of the wasted landscape of the dark empire, with the armies of the Lord of Shadows standing in rows, preparing to wage a war of conquest upon the land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next to the throne they find a luxurious nook with pillows, cat toys, and cat food - Cataclysm’s lair. In the nook they see the kidnapped mice kept in cages, if liberated they will help the players to defeat the cat.</p>
<p>The party fights the cat, steals and destroys his collar, and Cataclysm does a Reichenbach Fall off the dark tower. As the cat’s body hits the ground, there is an earth shaking cry from the Lord of Shadows, and the tower begins to crumble.</p>
<p>The mice emerge from the ruins battered and bruised, but alive, and return home victorious. The day has been saved, the armies of darkness are scattered, and their community need no longer live in fear of the minions of the Dark Lord and his insatiable cat.</p>

<p>Prehistoric Volcanic Island. Volcano recently became active, its lava is gradually filling the lower parts of the island, making the Dinofolk settlements uninhabitable, and forcing them to move up into the mountains. Now they're in a fierce battle for the territory with the mountain tribe of mammoth worshipers.</p>
<p>Primitive tribes of Ape-men live in the jungle between them, vampire-bats (the ancestors of the modern day vampires) live in the caves.</p>
<h2 id="summoning-ritual"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#summoning-ritual"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Summoning Ritual</h2>

<p>This spell he cast is his last hope, it is meant to summon the heroes who can save his tribe. The players must travel through the jungle, find the Dinotribe, and put an end to this conflict.</p>

<h2 id="defending-the-caves"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#defending-the-caves"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Defending the Caves</h2>
<p>Some of the Dinotribe people are riding raptors, others have shapeshifted into dinosaurs. One of them is a T-Rex. Tusk Shaman follows the players out of the caves and helps them in battle, by shapeshifting into a mammoth. After the battle, the remaining few Dinotribe warriors will escape. Players can choose to chase them, making it easier to find the Dinotribe.</p>
<h2 id="the-prehistoric-jungle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-prehistoric-jungle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Prehistoric Jungle</h2>
<p>Players make their way through the jungle (possibly chasing/tracking the escaping Dinotribe warriors). There’s a river of lava on their way that they must figure out how to cross. Once deep inside the jungle, they will find themselves surrounded by the warriors of the Ape Tribe.</p>

<h2 id="the-vampire-caves"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-vampire-caves"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Vampire Caves</h2>
<p>Chased by the Ape Tribe, players have to take a shortcut through the caves filled with vampire bats. Apes are too afraid to pursue players inside. To make it through the cave, the players will have to defeat the vampires, or hide/escape from them. On the other side of the caves is the Dinotribe settlement.</p>
<h2 id="the-dino-camp"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-dino-camp"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Dino Camp</h2>

<p>Freevale, the Town of Outcasts, is being terrorized every night by the monsters from beyond - zombies, ghosts, giant centipedes, huge sentient spiders, etc.</p>
<p>This happens ever since the townspeople have sent an expedition to the Empty Jewel, a Dead Dwarven City nearby. Underneath the city, the expedition has discovered the Gate to The Great Beyond. They took the Golden Key from it, accidentally unseailng the ancient portal to the "other side".</p>
<p>To save the town, the heroes must take the Key back to the portal and seal it again, once and for all.</p>
<h2 id="scenes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#scenes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Scenes</h2>
<h3 id="freevale-the-town-of-outcasts"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#freevale-the-town-of-outcasts"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Freevale, the Town of Outcasts</h3>
<p>The players are visiting Freevale, a Wild-West-style town where rejects from society (tieflings, orcs, goblins, mutants, werewolves) live together in peace. From talking to townspeople, they learn about the monster attacks, and learn that the town's Mayor is desperate for help.</p>
<h3 id="mayors-office"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mayors-office"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mayor's Office</h3>
<p>Mayor Wolfington is having a bad week.</p>

<p>Mayor of the Freevale. He's a werewolf, fighting the best he can to protect the city from the monsters.</p>
</div>
<p>The adventurers he has summoned to his office are his last hope - he can't hold off the scourge of the monsters on his own. He tells the players about the expedition, and gives them the location of the last survivor's house, their only lead - the Old Man McQue.</p>
<div className="character">
<h3 id="old-man-mcque"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#old-man-mcque"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Old Man McQue</h3>
<p>The last survivor of the expedition. He ran away in fear, abandoning his friends, and is now wrecked by guilt.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="giant-centipedes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#giant-centipedes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Giant Centipedes</h3>
<p>In the darkness between the buildings, you hear a pitter-patter of hundreds of tiny legs, and then see five glowing red dots - eyes of the giant centipede crwaling on the wall of the building. The sounds get louder, more are coming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can hide out inside the Old man McQues house, if they persuade him to overcome his fear and lower the defences around the house for them to come in.</p>
<p>He will tell them about the expedition. They have traveled to The Empty Jewel, an abandoned undergronud Dwarven city. They have discovered a room with an ancient Dwarven experiment - a gate to another world. When they tried to take a priceless Golden Key from it, they accidentally unsealed the gate, and the monsters poured out. He was the only one who managed to survive. He will give players the Golden Key they can use to close the Gate, if only they can reach it.</p>

<p>During the two day's journey towards the Gate, players can spend the night in an old abbey, which is the only place around you can use to hide from the monsters.</p>
<p>It has an old cemetery nearby, and at night, Zombies will rise from it. If players are not careful to stay on alert and board the doors, they will wake up to a growling, brain-eating surprise.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-tusk"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-big-tusk"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Big Tusk</h3>
<p>On their way, players will find an Orc settlement. It's close to the entrance to the Empty Jewel, and it was destroyed by the monsters coming out of the portal.</p>
<p>The heroes will meet the Orc King.</p>
<div className="character">
<h3 id="orc-king"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#orc-king"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Orc King</h3>
<p>Living in The Big Tusk, so close to the source of the monsters, and having lost all of his friends to the attacks, he has lost his grip on reality, and declared himself the "King fo Zombies". He trained a few zombies to serve him, and got accustomed to being the only living creature in the town.</p>
</div>
<p>He will try to turn the players into his zombie-minions, but can be convinced to help them on their mission (he can be easily fooled).</p>
<h3 id="the-empty-jewel"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-empty-jewel"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Empty Jewel</h3>
<p>An abandoned underground Dwarven city.</p>
<div className="token"><img src="/post/great-beyond/dwarven-citadel.jpg"/></div> 
<p>The Empty Jewel is filled with various otherworldly monsters wondering about, the most dangerous of which are giant interdimensional sentient spiders. The spiders know the way to the gate, and can be negotiated with. If the players are convincing, the spiders will help them to navigate the tunnels leading to the portal.</p>
<h3 id="the-portal-room"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-portal-room"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Portal Room</h3>
<p>A round chamber deep underneath the ground, is hidden behind a set of illusionary walls. A spiral staircase is leading to the Gate to The Great Beyond.</p>
<img src="/post/great-beyond/veil.png"/>
<p>In the portal room, the heroes will see an enormous Basilisk crawling out of the Gate. If given a chance, it will swallow the player holding the Key. Once the Basilisk is defeated and the Key is recovered, players can put it back into place, seal the Gate, and return to Freevale victorious.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A dwarven town built into the edges of the Grit Canyon is being attacked by sand worms (think Dune). Players must descend into the underdark, infiltrate the ancient Drow Metropolis, and defeat the Worm Master who uses his magic Wormulet to control the gigantic Worm Queen.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#summary"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>A dwarven town is being attacked by the gigantic sand worms. Dwarfs were building mines above the subterranean Drow settlement and accidentally caused cave-ins, breaking the tenuous peace between the two kingdoms. Drow retaliated by sending their Worm Riders and the Worm Master (capable of controlling the Worm Queen) to attack the town. Players need to steal the Worm Master’s worm controlling wormulet to put an end to the conflict.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-the-big-mama"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#meeting-the-big-mama"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meeting the Big Mama</h2>
<p>Players are traveling to the Dwarven town to deliver the supplies. On their way they see carriages surrounded by dead bodies - these people were trying to leave the city.</p>
<p>As they get closer, in the distance they see barricades at the gates of the city, at which point they are attacked by the shark-sized sand worms bursting from the ground and trying to eat them.</p>
<p><img src="/post/into-the-deep/big-mama.jpg" alt="">
Once the pack of the worms is defeated and they’re almost at the barricades, they are attacked by an angry train-sized Big Mama worm, attracted to the sounds of the battle.</p>
<h2 id="drow-predicament"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#drow-predicament"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Drow Predicament</h2>
<p>At the barricades, players meet Grak (the Dwarven Leader). He tells them about the situation they’re in - after the Dwarven miners have accidentally collapsed the caves and killed a bunch of Drow underneath them, the drow are attacking the town in revenge. Players need to find out how the Drow are controlling the sand worms, and find a way to defeat them (or find some other way to put an end to this conflict).</p>
<h2 id="the-valley-of-death"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-valley-of-death"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Valley of Death</h2>
<p>The Dwarven town (Darili Irid) is built into the edges of the Grit Canyon. Players must make their way to the rocky surface of the mine entrance through the sandy valley at the bottom of the canyon.</p>
<p><img src="/post/into-the-deep/canyon.jpg" alt="">
They can use a dwarven Dune-Buggy-like contraption and have an exciting chase scene with angry worms on their tail, they can hand-glide in off of the edge of the canyon (risking to land too far away from the tunnels), or find some other way.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-tunnels"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#into-the-tunnels"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Into the Tunnels</h2>
<p>In the tunnels the players will find an abandoned dwarven factory (contains dynamite, and spilled alchemical materials that mutate local critters), an underground river pouring into the bottomless abyss, and minecarts players can ride.</p>
<p>Deeper, the players will cross paths with a group of Worm Riders (think War Boys from Max Max) who are on their way to attack the town. On their necks, they have small amulets they’re using to control their worms. Worm Riders can be defeated in combat, have their steeds set upon them by destroying the amulets, or fooled (they’re not the brightest).</p>
<p>Players can ride the worms if they steal the amulets.</p>
<h2 id="the-drow-city"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-drow-city"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Drow City</h2>
<p>Players find the ancient metropolis illuminated by huge glowing mushrooms. They must sneak through the city streets and avoid getting noticed. Interrogating one of the Drow will reveal that the Worm Master resides in the palace in the middle of the city, and has the power to control the Big Mama.</p>
<p><img src="/post/into-the-deep/into-the-deep.jpg" alt="">
The palace is well guarded, but the players can stealth their way in, use disguises, or lie and convince the guards to let them in.</p>
<h2 id="his-worminess"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#his-worminess"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>His Worminess</h2>
<p>In the throne room there is the Worm Master and, coiled around the throne, the Big Mama (Worm Master is lovingly rubbing her belly). Around his neck - a large glowing Wormulet.</p>
<CharacterBox>
<h2 id="bartholomew"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#bartholomew"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Bartholomew</h2>
<p>Old creepy Drow Worm Master. Controls the worms using his Wormulet. Really loves his worms, perhaps even too much (think cat lady, but more sensual and tender). Uses Big Mama as his symbol of power.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>If the players manage to steal the Wormulet, the Big Mama awakens and goes rogue. They need to figure out how to use the amulet before they’re the worm food.</p>
<p>If the Worm Master notices them, he rides her in battle against the players, and they must flee through the city streets (think big disaster movie) until they find a way to get the wormulet off of the Worm Master’s neck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You dare to threaten my babies? Big Mama, I awaken thee! Eat them, Daisy!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If she swallows them, they will have to find a way out of her belly before it fills with the digestive juices.</p>
<p>If they go for a peaceful resolution, Worm Master will be willing to offer them much gold in exchange for betraying the Dwarves and leading Big Mama straight to the Dwarven Leader. He will be willing to settle for peace if the players find a persuasive enough argument.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resolution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>If peace was achieved both cities prosper together. If the players have gained control of the wormulet, Dwarves will offer a large reward in exchange for the Wormulet (they can use sand worms to help them dig tunnels).</p>

<p>Players are playing as tiny forest creatures. Their bayou is suffering from drought, the river nearby has dried out because the humans living nearby have built a dam. The animals need to destroy the dam, while being pursued by the animal “mafia” led by a Fox mastermind and a cocky Rattlesnake.</p>

<h2 id="shakedown-at-crickmoss"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#shakedown-at-crickmoss"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Shakedown At Crickmoss</h2>
<p><img src="/post/do-or-dry/crickmoss.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A gang of weasels rolls into Crickmoss - a peaceful village inhabited by small woodland creatures. The weasels are here to sell water, at exorbitant prices. They extort the town's mayor and boss everyone around. The town can’t afford to buy water for everyone, and after the weasels leave, the players must urgently go and solve the drought issue. Their plans are overheard by a mole who slinks away to report the situation to his boss.</p>
<h2 id="uncivil-serpent"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#uncivil-serpent"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Uncivil Serpent</h2>
<p>As players travel through the jungle towards the river (The Big Wet), they are accosted by a huge Rattlesnake (Dirty Monty). He tries to threaten them into turning away, and the players must find a way around him. If he suspects that they will disobey, he will attack. It is clear that he is too powerful to be defeated in a fair fight, so the players must flee or come up with some creative solution (the forest is full of opportunities to set up a trap or an ambush, the snake can be bribed or tricked).</p>
<h2 id="battle-at-the-fort-chuckwood"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#battle-at-the-fort-chuckwood"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Battle at the Fort Chuckwood</h2>
<p>The riverbed has completely dried out. There’s a small beaver dam being currently attacked by a gang of rowdy Salamander Pirates. The pirates have attached little wheels to their ship, enabling them to “sail” the dry river. If the players defeat the pirates, they can use their ship as a way of transportation. If the ship is destroyed or damaged, the grateful beavers will make players a new one.</p>
<h2 id="up-the-river"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#up-the-river"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Up the River</h2>
<p>As the players travel up the river, they will have to overcome The Churn (former River Rapids, now huge rocks and cliffs), get through the Gatortown - a group of layabout gators (they’ll agree not to eat you if you convince them that you can bring back the water), and get past human kids playing nearby (the kids are excited to see the animals and want them as pets).</p>
<p>Eventually the players will arrive at the dam that is blocking the river, and the human frontier town next to it.</p>
<h2 id="edgewood"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#edgewood"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Edgewood</h2>
<p>The weasels we have seen before are gathering water through the leaks in the dam, and carrying it to Edgewood - an animal settlement built at the junkyard next to the human city.</p>
<p><img src="/post/do-or-dry/weston-t-jones-trinndamfin-web.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If they notice the players, weasels will capture them and take them to their boss - Mr. Slysilver. If players remain hidden, they can track the weasels back to their headquarters.</p>
<CharacterBox>
<h2 id="mr-slysilver"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mr-slysilver"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mr. Slysilver</h2>
<p>A fox Mob Boss with the personality of Gus Fring. Used his control over the water to gain power and take over the city.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Players learn that the former mayor of Edgewood is locked up in jail, or are thrown into jail with him.</p>
<p>He knows the weak spot in the dam, and how to bring it down - there’s a ship up-river from the dam that can be stolen and steered into it. He will help the players if they help him escape.</p>
<h2 id="through-the-town"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#through-the-town"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Through the Town</h2>
<p>To get to the docks, the players must make their way through the town. They will make their way through the streets filled with humans, wagons, and horses. Cross a busy road, get into the middle of a drunken bar fight. If they get noticed by people, they will be hunted by animal control.</p>
<h2 id="stealing-the-ship"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#stealing-the-ship"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Stealing the Ship</h2>
<p>The docks are guarded by a night watchman and a group of dutiful german shepherds. The players will need to get through the fence, through the docs, and onto the ship. On board, they will have to deal with the drowsy ship captain and his sailors.</p>
<p>Once they have managed to take control of the ship, they can steer it into the dam.</p>
<h2 id="daaammmm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#daaammmm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Daaammmm!</h2>
<p>The ship smashes into the dam, destroying it. The heroes gloriously ride the wave of refreshing water down the river, back home. The town is saved, and the ship becomes a part of their settlement.</p>

<p>The players need to rescue a rebellious teenage tiefling (Anabelle) who was sentenced to life in prison for a petty crime, and is now being delivered to the prison. She is being transported by Zeppelin, guarded by Paladins. Players will need to steal the papers describing the Zeppelin’s schedule and route, steal griffons to chase it and board it, find and liberate Anabelle, escape and cover their tracks.</p>
<h2 id="thomas-begging-the-judge"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#thomas-begging-the-judge"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Thomas Begging the Judge</h2>
<p><img src="/post/zeppelin-heist/new-albion.jpg" alt="">
Players begin their adventure in New Albion - a steampunk city. They start near the courthouse, watching Thomas Thatcher begging Judge Boon to let Anabelle go.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/zeppelin-heist/frank.png">
<h2 id="thomas-thatcher"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#thomas-thatcher"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Thomas Thatcher</h2>
<p>Anabelle’s father. He had an affair with a succubus, she used him for rent money, then left him with their daughter. Desperate to rescue Anabelle (Galier from Dimension 20).</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>The Judge denies in the most annoying/smug/condescending way.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/zeppelin-heist/judge-boon.png">
<h2 id="judge-boon"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#judge-boon"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Judge Boon</h2>
<p>Smug, condescending, racist against tieflings (Dolores Umbridge).</p>
</CharacterBox>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> "She's just a kid, please let her go, this is barbaric!"<br>
<strong>Judge Boon:</strong> "She has committed a crime, my dear boy, and the crime must be punished. Justice must be served. She will pay for her crimes, she will pay indeed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Judge leaves, Thomas turns to players, asking them for help to rescue his daughter. He knows that she's being transported to prison today, but doesn't know exactly when or how. He knows that there must be papers describing her transfer in the police precinct, and he will show players her photo so that they could recognize her.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/zeppelin-heist/anabelle.png">
<h2 id="anabelle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#anabelle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Anabelle</h2>
<p>A teenage tiefling who has committed a petty crime (summoning a flock of pigeons above the Holy Archpriest’s statue) and was sentenced to life in prison by a judge who’s racist against tieflings. Fig from Dimension 20, Kate from Lost.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<h2 id="stealing-papers-from-the-police-precinct"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#stealing-papers-from-the-police-precinct"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Stealing papers from the Police Precinct</h2>
<p>The documents describing the Zeppelin route/schedule are located on the second floor of the Police Precinct. During the day it is filled with the cops. At night the first floor is guarded by a sleepy guard, the second floor is cleaned by a janitor.</p>
<p>In front of the entrance players will meet a Buerocrat - he can be bribed, convinced, intimidated, or tricked into giving up the information.</p>
<p>From the papers the players will learn that Anabelle is being transported from the Skyport, right now . She is guarded by paladins, and transported by Zeppelin. She is being shipped off to Crimora - a middle-eastern-type country, a lovely location for the tourists, a horrific inescapable prison for Anabelle.</p>
<h2 id="skyport"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#skyport"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Skyport</h2>
<img src="/post/zeppelin-heist/skyport.jpg"/>
<p>Players arrive at the Skyport. They see zeppelins and skyships coming in and out. The Anabelle's zeppelin has just left.</p>
<p>To chase the Zeppelin the players can steal the griffons from the griffon stables (griffons are locked, taken care of by the stableman). They would need to convince the rowdy griffons to follow their commands (bribe with treats, talk to animals, animal handling).</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/zeppelin-heist/griffon-baby.jpg">
<h2 id="griffons"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#griffons"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Griffons</h2>

<p><img src="/post/zeppelin-heist/airship.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="boarding-zeppelin"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#boarding-zeppelin"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Boarding Zeppelin</h2>
<p><img src="/post/zeppelin-heist/zeppelin-2.jpg" alt="">
If the players are using the griffons, they can stealthily board on the upper deck of the Zeppelin. If they're not careful, they will get noticed by a snooty butler.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/zeppelin-heist/alfred.png">
<h2 id="snooty-servant"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#snooty-servant"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Snooty Servant</h2>
<p>A pretentious butler the players will meet on the zeppelin. Happy to extort a bribe if he sees players doing something they're not supposed to. "Excuse me sir, our rules don’t allow boarding mid flight."</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Tbe butler will raise alarms unless he's intimidated/bribed/etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I apologize, sir, boarding in the middle of the trip is prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the players are using Airship, they will need to find a way to convince the Zeppelin captain to let them on board. Airship can be docked to the Zeppelin by extending a rope bridge connecting the two ships.</p>
<h2 id="finding-anabelle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#finding-anabelle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Finding Anabelle</h2>
<p>The Zeppelin is huge, think Titanic. It carries many civilian passengers on the upper deck, and personnel taking care of the Zeppeline in the lower decks.</p>
<h3 id="upper-deck"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#upper-deck"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Upper Deck</h3>
<p>It has passenger cabins, dining room, swimming pool. It looks like an expensive cruise.
They can talk to the passengers or the servants to learn that the Paladins are stationed in the lower deck.</p>
<h3 id="lower-deck"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lower-deck"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lower Deck</h3>
<p>Anabelle is transported in a small locked jail cell, along with a bunch of tough and dangerous criminals, guarded by paladins. There’s a common room where guards are celebrating Commander’s promotion, the Commander holds the key to the Anabelle's jail cells.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/zeppelin-heist/edgar-sharp.png">
<h2 id="commander-edgar-sharp"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#commander-edgar-sharp"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Commander Edgar Sharp</h2>
<p>Paladin Captain. Gruff, badass, extremely experienced, exhausted from dealing with incompetent guards.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>To sneak into the lower decks they will need to get past the guards. They can steal Paladin armor from the locker room to impersonate them, crawl through the vents, disguise as entertainment, or whatever the players come up with.</p>
<h2 id="rescuing-anabelle"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#rescuing-anabelle"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Rescuing Anabelle</h2>
<p>Players can steal the Commander's key, cause a distraction and break into the cell, or convince Commander/Guards to let Anabelle go.</p>
<p>The rough and dangerous criminals in Anabelle's cell can present a problem.</p>
<p>If they break her out - they will be chased by the paladins, they'll need to make their way back to their Airship/Griffons, ideally avoiding casualties among the passengers.</p>
<p>If they have arrived on griffons, the griffons may have gotten loose among the passengers, some people are running away, some children are playing with them. Capture the griffons while running away from the guards.</p>
<p>Then they can fly back to the City.</p>
<h2 id="mountains"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mountains"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mountains</h2>
<p>If necessary, the players can fake an emergency (for example pull a fire alarm), make Zeppelin land, or accidentally make it crash. They can escape in the chaos, blend in with the crowd.</p>
<p>If the players crash/land Zeppelin mid-journey, they will be in the mountains. They can hide from paladin search parties looking for them in the forest or in a cave, make their way to the small mountain village, wait out the night and fly back to the city on their griffons. Or they can convince the villagers to hide Anabelle until the dust settles.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resolution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>Once Thomas is reunited with his daughter he's extremely happy and grateful, and will give the players rewards. He and Anabelle will happily help them on their future adventures to the best of his ability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Die Hard in Hogwarts. The Academy of Arcane Arts and Adventures has been taken over by the group of vampires. They seek Valery McClane, the daughter of the Vampire Hunter. Her father has cursed the vampire clan, turning them mortal, and only drinking her blood can undo the curse.</p>
<p>The vampires have tricked a student into disabling the school’s defenses, opened the portal into the Main Hall, mind-controlled the teachers, and are now searching for Valery, and taking the students through the portal into the clan’s lair - the dark tower.</p>
<p>The players will need to infiltrate the castle taken over by the vampires, awaken the security djinn to protect the students, and then pursue the vampires through the portal to rescue the kidnapped ones.</p>

<h1 id="scenes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#scenes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Scenes</h1>
<h2 id="receiving-the-letter"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#receiving-the-letter"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Receiving the Letter</h2>
<p>The heroes begin in the old and grimey tavern ("Toadshead") in the Northwick - a small magical village close to the Adventuring Academy (basically Hogsmeade).</p>
<p>They can see the castle of the Adventuring Academy out of the window, in the distance, and soon they notice that the protective barrier around the school (like a soap bubble surrounding the castle ) has disappeared at some point.</p>
<p>Soon an exhausted and beaten up looking owl smashes through the window, carrying a letter to the bartender. The letter is bloodstained and written in a rushed handwriting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The school is under attack. Send help. Northen tower.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="traveling-to-the-academy"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#traveling-to-the-academy"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Traveling to the Academy</h2>
<p>There are stables with griffons next to the tavern. There's also a secret passage between the tavern and the school.</p>
<p>The griffons can deliver the players straight to the Northen tower, but can be noticed from the school's windows.</p>
<p><img src="/post/blood-of-the-hunter/adventuring-academy.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-owlery"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-owlery"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Owlery</h2>
<p>The Northern Tower is the Owlery for postal owls. Inside it the players will find Valery McClane, a young student of the academy (Valery McClane) who sent the letter. She looks injured, and is trying to hold the door. Something strong is smashing through it, trying to get it to open.</p>
<p>Valery explains to the players that the school has been taken over by the vampires. Her dad has put a curse onto their clan, making them mortal, and only her blood ("The blood of the Hunter") can lift this curse.</p>
<p>The thing smashing through the door is a gremlin, one of the many dark creatures the vampires have brought along with them to take control of the school.</p>
<h2 id="captured-students"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#captured-students"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Captured Students</h2>
<p>After the gremlin has been defeated, the players will descend into the school corridors, and see vampires capturing kids in the corridors, hypnotizing them, and dragging them to the main dining hall.</p>
<p>The main hall is filled with the captured students and professors. Professors are hypnotized into obeying vampire's orders. Students are being used as hostages. There's clearly too many vampires to take head on. There's a portal in the middle, leading to the vampires lair.</p>
<p>The players will meet a cowardly professor hiding from the vampires. He will tell them that the Headmaster's office has a security system that can help to fight off the vampires. They will also learn that the Potion Master's Office has garlic, the Chapel has holy water, and Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom has silver weapons and stakes. With these advantages, defeating vampires would actually be possible.</p>
<h2 id="collecting-weapons"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#collecting-weapons"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Collecting Weapons</h2>
<p><img src="/post/blood-of-the-hunter/slimer.jpg" alt="">
As the players travel between locations, collecting ways to defeat the vampires, they can encounter some threats and dangers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitten student turning into a vampire.</li>
<li>Corridor covered in the red webs, a few students trapped in them, giant spiders.</li>
<li>Double-agent teacher, secretly on the side of the vampires. Will summon reinforcements if the players ask for help.</li>
<li>Ghost excited about the vampire invasion. If the players convince it to take the side of the students, he’ll open a secret passageway leading them to their destination.</li>
<li>Small group of students organizing their own resistance, desperately fighting an overwhelming force of vampires.</li>
<li>A group of skeletons/zombies working for the vampires. It's just a job for them and they don't wanna do it, they're happy to slack off as long as players convince them that won't get them into trouble.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="headmasters-office"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#headmasters-office"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Headmaster's Office</h2>
<p>Headmaster's office is guarded by the two stone gargoyles who don't let anyone in without the Headmaster's permission. They can be tricked, distracted, or defeated in battle.</p>
<p>Inside his office, the players will find a magic Lamp containing a Security Djinn. Djinn won't be able to fight the vampires himself (it's magic is making him non-violent), but he can restore the protective barrier around the school, and he has the power to teleport the students within his line of sight to safety.</p>
<p>He will also tell the players that the portal has been opened through a ritual that took place in the Herbology greenhouses, on the roof right above the main hall. If the ritual is disrupted, the portal will slowly begin to close.</p>
<h2 id="fight-in-the-main-hall"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#fight-in-the-main-hall"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Fight in the Main Hall</h2>
<p>Equipped with the Djinn and the anti-vampire weapons, players can successfully fight off the vampires in the Main Hall. Djinn will be able to transport the students held hostage, while the players deal with the vampires.</p>
<p>Once the majority of the vampires have been defeated Veronica Sharp (the leader of the vampires) will escape through the portal. At this point the Djinn will note that some of the students are missing - they have been taken through the portal to the vampire's lair.</p>
<h2 id="black-tower"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#black-tower"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Black Tower</h2>
<div className="token"><img  src="/post/blood-of-the-hunter/dark-tower.jpg"/></div> 
<p>A vampire lair is a black tower rising above the blood-red ocean. The portal between the Tower and the Academy is on the top floor, kidnapped students have been taken to the throne room in the basement.</p>
<p>They can sneak them out, or take on Veronica Sharp head on. If Veronica Sharp dies, the tower will begin to crumble, and the portal will slowly begin to close, gradually decreasing in diameter. The players will need to rush to return before the portal closes.</p>
<h2 id="happy-ending"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#happy-ending"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Happy Ending</h2>
<p>Closing the portal or killing Veronica Sharp will lift the hypnosis from the professors. Professors and students will be grateful for the rescue, and will do their best to help players. Valery's father, Damien McClane will be happy to help them on future adventures.</p>

<p>The merfolk palace has been taken, and their princess has been kidnapped, in a plot orchestrated by the young power-hungry merfolk prince. He has promised to lead Captain Steamtooth (a gnomish steampunk submarine pirate) to his father’s Trident (which controls the Kraken) in exchange for kidnapping and killing the princess (so that he could rule the kingdom instead of her).

<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/beach.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Players are taking a small vacation/weekend, chilling on the beach, when they see the ocean water bubbling, seeming to boil, and a huge group of merfolk are marching onto the land from the water. They seem distraught, agitated.</p>
<p>A small group in the middle are carrying a huge tent with the Old King Silvair on his throne. Jebediah and General Tasaru are accompanying him. Old Kind Silvair is holding an impressive and clearly magical Trident.</p>
<p>They will beg anyone who'll listen to help them liberate their city, which has been taken over by the pirates, and to rescue their princess.</p>

<p>The Merfolk have access to Gillyweed - a magical algie that will allow the players to breathe under water. They will also tell them that they have seen a few submarine pods in the port nearby.</p>
<p>There are two pods, created by a cooky and eccentric inventor. They are untested, one of them is half broken, the previous testing crew didn't survive the experiment. He'll be happy to give them to players in exchange for feedback on his inventions. Pods are fast and have powerful weapons, but are more noticeable, and not very reliable.</p>
<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/submarine-pod.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Merfolk people also have trained sharks players can ride. Sharks can get rowdy and dangerous though.</p>
<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/shark-rider.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="merfolk-city"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#merfolk-city"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Merfolk City</h2>
<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/underwater.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Players talk to the merfolk general, come up with a plan, train the merfolk soldiers, and travel to the merfolk city. Merfolk Prince and the General will join them, the Prince will take his father's Triden't with him.</p>
<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/merfolk-city6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They see combat raging in the middle of the city - merfolk soliders are attacking the palace occupied by pirates. Pirates shoot back, their submarine has powerful weapons holding them at bay.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to fight your way into the palace, but it's possible to use the hidden passageway to the throne room.</p>
<h2 id="hostage-negotiations"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#hostage-negotiations"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Hostage Negotiations</h2>
<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/throne-room.jpg" alt="">
Inside the palace players will see Captain Steamtooth, his first-mate One-Eyed Willy, their captive Djinn Kali El, and a bunch of pirates carrying the treasure from the palace to the submarine. Pirates are wearing necklases that allow them to breathe under water.</p>
<p>Captain Steamtooth is willing to exchange the merfolk princess for the Trident. But once he gets his hands on the trident, he escapes to his submarine, without liberating the princess.</p>
<p>One-Eyed Willy is grumpy, and it's clear that he doesn't enjoy following captain's orders. If players establish contact with him, he’ll be able to help them later in exchange for helping him stage a coup.</p>
<p>If the players help to liberate the captured Djinn, she can help them to defeat the captain.</p>
<h2 id="chase-and-board-the-submarine"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#chase-and-board-the-submarine"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Chase and Board the Submarine</h2>
<p><img src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/submarine6.jpg" alt="">
The princess is held on the Captain's submarine.  Players can sneak onto it before it departs, or chase it. They can break in, teleport in, convince the captain’s first mate to open a hatch, or use the powers of Kali El to help them get in.</p>
<p>The submarine is filled with pirates ready to trigger the alarm the moment something goes wrong.</p>
<h2 id="defeat-the-captain-steamtooth"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#defeat-the-captain-steamtooth"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Defeat the Captain Steamtooth</h2>
<p>The princess is held at the back of the submarine, in the giant fish tank, guarded by two pirates. If the fish tank breaks, the princess will start running out of air until she's put back into the water again.</p>
<p>If the players confront the Captain Steamtooth and he realizes that he’s at a disadvantage, he will use his Trident to summon the Kraken.</p>
<div className="token"><img  src="/post/steamtooth-gambit/submarine5.jpg"/></div> 
<p>It's possible to take over the submarine and use it to fight or escape the Kraken. If the players liberate Kali El - she will help them to defeat it. It's also possible to defeat the Captain, take his Trident, and gain control of the Kraken.</p>
<p>Before dying, the Captain Steamtooth will mention that everything was Jebediah's plan, who wanted to take over the throne and give them the Trident in exchange for killing the Princess.</p>
<h2 id="return-the-princess-and-the-trident"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#return-the-princess-and-the-trident"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Return the Princess and the Trident</h2>
<p>Once the Captain Steamtooth and the Kraken have been defeated, the players can return the Princess and the Trident back to the city and receive rewards from the grateful merfolk. They can also decide what punishment is fit for Jebediah. The merfolk will be happy to help them in the future adventures.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-characters"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introducing-characters"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introducing Characters</h2>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/ship.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The players begin on a ship, about to arrive at the port.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You have been sailing for several weeks now, your course is Cypress, the capital of Anglecynn, the biggest city on the whole continent. At this point you’re so tired of the ocean, you sincerely hope to never see a drop of water again in your life. Luckily, today is supposed to be the last day of your travels, you’re about to arrive.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You're sitting at an old grimy table, on a middle deck of a ship, waiting for the miserable journey to end.  A piratey-looking sailor, with eyepatches on both of his eyes, comes up to you, pours himself a mug full of rum, and drinks it down in one gulp, and asks “: “What brings you to Cypress, mateys? And what do you look like? I'm really out of the loop here.” He points, sadly, at his eyepatches.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(It’s time to introduce your characters)</p>
<h2 id="we-see-land"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#we-see-land"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>We see land!</h2>
<p>Sailors notice the land, we're about to arrive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As your conversation continues, suddenly you hear the voice from the upper deck “Land! We've made it! Thank the gods!” You weren't sure you would, successfully sailing to your destination in the medieval times is always a coin toss. You hear many excited voices and commotion from the upper deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prompt the players to go up to the upper deck and take a look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sailor stands up from the table "Alright, mateys, I'll go up, take a loo..." he cuts himself off, "Smell some fresh air, I guess" he finishes sadly. "Follow me if you wish to see the City in all of its glory"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="arriving-into-the-port"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#arriving-into-the-port"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Arriving into the Port</h3>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/02_Dreamland.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Description of Cypress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You walk up to the top deck of the ship, look ahead, and behold the glorious city of Cypress. A huge castle with white walls at the top of the cliff, and the city surrounding it. The city looks quite a bit scruffier than the castle, but it’s the most impressive one you’ve seen so far. Soon enough, your ship will arrive and dock in the bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Description of the Port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You arrive at the port, the ship docks, and you finally feel the firm ground underneath your feet. You see many sailors running down the gangway onto the bustling boardwalk. Some of them drop on their knees, crying, kissing the earth. It’s been a long time for these dudes. Many ships are in this port, people are walking around, delivering cargo to and from the ships, selling their wares.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="meeting-the-rat"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#meeting-the-rat"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meeting the Rat</h2>
<p>Players encounter the rat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amid all the hustle-and-bustle, you notice something very unusual - a fat ginger rat is scurrying directly towards you. It's noticeably distressed. In it's little teeth, it's carrying a scroll. You hear agitated squeaks. "Squeak squeak squeak!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players read the scroll:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It drops a scroll into your hand. You determine it to be a scroll outlining a spell “Speak with Animals.” Whoever touches it and reads it, shall gain the ability to speak to any animal for an hour. Works on multiple people.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="rats-story"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#rats-story"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Rat's Story</h3>
<p>The Rat tells players it's story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the spell is complete, you hear the Rat's frantic squeaking turn into comprehensible speech:<br>
“...to you! Come on! Just read the damn scro…” the rat notices changes in your expression “Can you… Can you understand me now? Finally!”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
Don't you see? Don't you get what is going on? Traitors! Backstabbers! Charlatans!
<hr/>
What am I? What am I? I'm the king of this bloody kingdom, that's who I am!! And you must help me! You're the only ones who can.
<hr/>
My vizier, Jafar, the treacherous bastard, has turned me into a rat and he's currently sitting on my throne ruling my kingdom! Consolidating power.
<hr/>
You must help me retrieve his wand of transfiguration, that's the only way to turn me back. He keeps it in his tower, the tower is in the castle.
<p>The King attempts to command the players to rescue him, if that fails he will promise much gold and favors in return for their help.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/rat.png">
<h2 id="king-amathar"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#king-amathar"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>King Amathar</h2>
<p>Very pompous and self-important, he's used to sycophants and yes-men hanging on his every word and satisfying his every whim. Being turned into a rat did nothing to humble him, and he keeps being surprised and frustrated that people don't instantly follow his squeaky commands.</p>
<p>He's pretty sure that he's the greatest, most beloved King that he's ever lived. Is he? Meh, he's alright. Not the most competent king who's ever lived, but better than Jafar, and just sympathetic enough to be worth helping.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-the-minions"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#meeting-the-minions"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meeting the Minions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The rat is interrupted, and looks back behind it. "Oh no, they're here!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You feel the earth underneath your feet slightly tremble and hear thud-thud-thud of heavy footsteps. You see a huge figure of a half-orc running towards you, his eyes locked on the rat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you notice about him is his huge heap of beautiful brown hair, it's like, what shampoo is this guy using to make it so magnificent? Anyway, the second thing is a huge club in his hand that half the size of your body. It seems to have a few blood stains and someone's teeth stuck to it. He stops a few paces away from you, panting, looks around, and notices the rat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zug is searching for a Rat he accidentally let escape.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/guz.png">
<h2 id="zug"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#zug"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Zug</h2>
<p>Zug is a half-orc that was tasked with guarding the rat, and he's now really worried he'll be in trouble because the rat has escaped. He's simple but loyal (think Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove).</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Zug will do his best to negotiate with the players, but if he senses it's not working he'll skip to violence:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Um... Hello... I am, uh, Zug. This rat belongs to the Master, please step aside, I'll go ahead and take it back now.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zug will be in so much trouble.</li>
<li>It is of great sent-ee-mental value to the Master. Negoni, netogi, negonitate!</li>
<li>I must get it, you see, Mr Jafar told me to guard it, Zug will be in so much trouble if he finds out it escaped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players can fight him, fool him, or even befriend him.</p>
<p>Before the conversation begins to die down, the new character enters the scene:</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/gretchen.png">
<h2 id="gretchen"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#gretchen"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Gretchen</h2>
<p>Angry old Hag, Jafar's main minion/partner. They both have blackmail on each other and they both owe favors to each other. She was the one who has found the wand and helped Jafar to execute his plan. Now she'll stop at nothing to get the King back. She's frail but really smart. (Izma from The Emperor's New Groove).</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Gretchen is Zug's perpetually angry and disappointed boss who's here to lead the search and make sure that her minion doesn't screw up again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see an old woman catching up with Zug. And when I say old I mean fucking OLD, like she was born before calcium was invented. She is surprisingly spry though.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zug! What the hell are you doing?</li>
<li>I'm, uh... I want to get the kin.. I mean rat, but they won't give it.</li>
<li>So hit them on the head with a stick and take it!</li>
<li>I was trying the, uh, diplomacy.</li>
<li>Just get the rat you idiot!</li>
<li>Okay…</li>
<li>Pazuzu! Where the hell are you, you useless animal! Get the rat, get the rat!</li>
<li>You kids, give me the rat! I don’t have time for your nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<p>High in the sky, the players will notice the third minion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see a strange shadow flying high in the atmosphere. Too large for a bird, too small for a blimp. What is it? You have no idea. It circles around, ominously, then begins to descend in the direction of the hag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pazuzu is here to provide aerial support to his cronies.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/pazuzu.png">
<h2 id="pazuzu"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pazuzu"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Pazuzu</h2>
<p>A gargoyle with a difficult personality. He will be circling the skies above the city, making it necessary for players to stay hidden as they make their way to the castle.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>If the scene with Zug/Gretchen takes too long, he'll join the battle, try to capture the rat, and return it to the Vizier's tower. If the players escape before this happens, or defend the rat, the rat will be able to help them find the castle, give them tips, tell them about secret catacombs. Otherwise they'll need to make it to the tower on their own, and rescue the rat along with the wand.</p>
<h2 id="cypress"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#cypress"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Cypress</h2>
<p>The rat will tell the players which way to go, the biggest challenge is to get through the city unseen from the sky.</p>
<h3 id="city-streets"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#city-streets"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>City Streets</h3>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/03_city-streets.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>City streets are pretty unremarkable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People are bustling around, going by their daily business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can find a magic item shop, weapons shop, potions shops, a tavern.</p>
<h3 id="town-square"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#town-square"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Town Square</h3>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/04-city-center.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Players arrive at the city center. To reach the gates(or catacombs) they have to cross a wide open area not covered by buildings, without being seen from the sky.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You arrive at the town square. You see the castle gate in the distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="city-gates"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#city-gates"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>City Gates</h3>
<p>City gates are heavily guarded. Players will have to somehow sneak or talk their way through the guards(it looks like fighting through them is not something players can survive)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The draw bridge is down, but the gate is guarded by two guards.
Guards:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stop right there! State your business!</li>
</ul>
<p>If the players tell the truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One guard turns to another one:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>That is the stupidest lie I have ever heard, huh, bobby</li>
<li>No doubt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gunther"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#gunther"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Gunther</h3>
<p>If the players are really stuck, they'll see a peasant name Gunther giving them a look. He will offer to sneak them through the gates inside one of the barrels he's delivering for the feast, as long as they give him a very valuable item, and name their first born after him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You notice one of the peasants is trying to look like he's just minding his own business, but his eyes actually dart at you, he seems to be observing you.
Hey fellas. I'm Gunther. I see you want to get into the castle. I can help cha, I can sneak you in my cart, inside the barrels. But it'll cost cha.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="catacombs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#catacombs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Catacombs</h3>
<p>The king may tell the players about the secret passege to the castle through the catacombs, if they ask. There's a door to the catacombs underneath the bridge. The door is locked. Inside the catacombs it's dark, and if you feel like adding an extra challenge, there can be a pack of dog-sized rats with glowing eyes. Also, one of the tunnels may have collapsed, and the players may need to move heavy stones out of the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see small points of light glowing in the dark. As you come closer, you see it’s the eyes of a bunch of mean looking dog-sized rats.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tower"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#tower"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Tower</h2>
<img className="small frame" src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/05-wizard-tower-1.png"/>
<p>After players make their way through the catacombs or through the gate, they see Jafar's tower:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You enter a castle, and have no trouble noticing a tall, slender, magnificent tower that is, well, towering over you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tower-entrance"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#tower-entrance"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Tower Entrance</h3>
<p>The only way into the tower is through the giant metal gates. They are sealed by magic, they have no obvious lock, but they have a handle in the shape of a snake, and a bell.</p>
<p><strong>Snake Handle</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see a door handle in a shape of a snake. Small emerald eyes reflect the sky, making it seem almost alive.
If the player touches the snake handle, it comes alive and bites them. Now they're poisoned, and will lose one HP per minute, until they find the antidote (Laboratory in the tower has a lot of potions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Door Bell</strong></p>
<p>Door bell answers in an autoresponder voice and lets them in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say "One" if you dare to request an audience with the Vizier. Say "Two" if you come bearing gifts for his lordship. Say "Three" if you feel unworthy to even be in his presence. Say "Four" if you and would like to take this opportunity to walk away before incurring his wrath. Say "Five" if you would like to proceed against your better judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reception"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#reception"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Reception</h3>
<p>The first floor has a receptionist (clay golem) sitting in the middle behind the table. Next to the walls are 5 large empty suits of armor - the security system. If the receptionist feels threatened, they can activate them, making them come alive and attack the players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The room seems unnaturally enormous, way larger than the tower looks from the outside. You see a square table, and behind it a small clay golem. It seems to be polishing it’s nails and staring at a small hand-held mirror, talking to someone on the other side "And I told him, not today mister. And then he was like, I don't care. And I was like, ugh, You know what I mean?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The receptionist will ask them if they have an appointment, and check it's records to see if what they're saying is true. Players can try lying, using illusions, or subduing it before it can trigger the alarm.</p>
<p>After receptionist has been dealt with, the players can go up to the next floor by using the staircase.</p>
<h3 id="the-office"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-office"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Office</h3>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/the-office.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The second floor of the tower is the Vizier's office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The room looks like the office where he holds political meetings. It has a large desk in the center, papers, all neat and tidy. A crystal globe standing off to the side.
There's a portrait of a man with big mustache on the wall, his eyes, and his moustache, seem to follow them wherever they move. A set of diplomas and impressive looking papers hang around the painting. “Most Creative Use Of A Bigby’s Hand Spell”, “In recognition of contributions to the Most Noble Art of Conjuration”,  “Graduate of the Arcane Arts at Samadar’s School For Gifted Youths”. Portrait, crystal on his desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a player decides to activate the crystal (by touching it and funneling 1 point of energy into it), they will see a vision of many things, among them - the location of the wand and Vizier sitting on the throne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you touch the crystal, the time and space unfold in front of his vision. He sees flashes of images. A giant empty cathedral. A dragon sleeping on a pile of gold. A round room with a desk, somewhere high above, with a glowing rod laying among it's contents. A vampire drinking blood from the neck of a young maiden. A tall slender man sitting on a throne. A city the likes of which you've never seen, gleaming with light, with buildings as tall as the sky, horseless carriages driving back and forth on the straight lines of it's roads. A giant tentacled creature dwelling in the depths of the ocean. An old man playing fetch with his dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-laboratory"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-laboratory"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Laboratory</h3>
<p>The next floor is Vizier's laboratory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like a study, or a laboratory. A desk filled with vials and bubbling potions(unlabeled). A pentagram on the floor, with a tiny demon-like creature sitting in the middle, looking bored. A small cage with an ordinary looking coffee table sitting inside it, whimpering pitifully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the players decide to open the cage with the animated coffee table - it will happily run off to it's freedom. If they interact with the demon-like creature, it will say something mean in the language they don't undersand, show them a rude gesture, and get back to looking bored.</p>
<p>One of the potions contains the antidote to the snake handle's venom, but potions are unlabeled. Drinking them randomly will produce random effects - reversing the gravity for the player, making them hallucinate, making them fall in love with whatever they're looking at, etc.</p>
<h3 id="the-observatory"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-observatory"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Observatory</h3>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/observatory.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next room is where Vizier studies parallel dimensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a huge telescope in the middle of the room, maps of the starlit sky, and what looks like a model of some kind of planetary system. The room is illuminated by ominous rays of red light streaming from the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the players look out of the window, they'll see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you pass by the window, you inadvertently see a deep blue sky, above the dark red ocean. Three red moons illuminate the strange scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a player steps into the red light:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You feel something deep inside of you awaken, the primal rage, the thirst for blood. You look at your companions. Why have you never thought your companions would make for a good breakfast?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The window can be blocked by something opaque.</p>
<h3 id="top-floor"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#top-floor"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Top Floor</h3>
<p>At the top floor the players will find the desk with a wand laying on top of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the table nearby you see a rod you saw in your vision. The rod emits green light and a quiet humming sound. Once you take it, you feel mighty and powerful, like anything in the world could be reshaped according to your will. You hear the whale of an alarm, and soon, footsteps from the lower floors of the tower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the middle of the room is the portal gate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the center of the room you see a large obsidian circle, large enough to walk through, standing vertically on a pitch black pedestal. It looks like a strange gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="transforming-the-king"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#transforming-the-king"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Transforming the King</h2>
<p>When the rat sees the wand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rat jumps up and down on your shoulder, forgetting any shreds of the kingly dignity it had left, unable to contain it's excitement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a player activates the wand to transform the rat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the sound of thunder and lightning, the room fills with the blazing green light. Streams of mana and energy surround the Rat in a blinding whirlwind of light and power. You can barely see the shape of the Rat growing, changing. Surprised squeaks gradually lower in pitch, becoming shrieks and then grunts of a human.
As the magic and might begin to settle, you behold with your own eyes the majesty of the true king of this kingdom in his natural, human form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At last, the king is free.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/king.png">
<h2 id="king-in-his-human-form"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#king-in-his-human-form"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>King in his human form</h2>
<p>King turns into a human in all his grumpy and disheveled glory.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<h3 id="throne-room"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#throne-room"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Throne Room</h3>
<p><img src="/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/throne-room.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If the players activate the portal gate, it will open a wormhole into the throne room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After you finish your manipulations, the space inside the circle seems to disappear, as if the hole has been torn through the universe, and on the other side, you see the throne room, a tall slender man sitting on the throne, and a few dozen of guards around him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jafar enjoys his time ruling the kingdom and ordering people around.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/jafar.png">
<h2 id="jafar"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#jafar"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Jafar</h2>
<p>Treacherous and obsequious Vizier. Extremely competent, probably more competent at running the kingdom than the King, but his intelligence is only used to further his own goals (Little Finger from Game of Thrones).</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Jafar looks surprised and shocked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your Majesty! I'm so happy to see you again! Everybody, rejoice, the lost king has returned!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If by the time players are in the throne room the king is still in the rat form, the guards will follow Vizier's commands, otherwise they will do what the King tells them to.</p>
<p>Vizier will try to talk/grovel his way to King's mercy, or set the guards on players and try to fight them.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-rewards"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#conclusion-and-rewards"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Conclusion and Rewards</h3>
<p>Once the Vizier has been defeated, the King will attempt to save face and take credit by claiming that it was his "brilliant leadership" that has secured this victory, but in the end, will be grateful to the players, and grant each player a request (if they remind him that he owes them).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Is the gratitude of the king not enough for you people? Fine!" The King snaps his fingers in the direction of one of his servants. "Ignacius, dash to the treasury, fetch us some of the finest [whatever players ask].</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#summary"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>The players meet a child dragon, he's crying because an Evil Princess has kidnapped his mom. The players will need to set her free from the Coliseum where she is forced to fight monsters and gladiators for public's entertainment.</p>
<h2 id="stroll-through-the-forest"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#stroll-through-the-forest"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Stroll through the Forest</h2>
<p><img src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/forest.jpg" alt="">
The players walk through the forest, and hear the sad roars in the distance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been traveling together for awhile, passing the fields, rivers, and small villages. Now you're walking down a narrow road through the shady forest, it’s quite quiet and peaceful. Suddenly, you hear a roar in the distance, then again - a little louder this time. It seems to be coming from the direction you’re headed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The roars are coming from some mysterious beast dwelling in a forest clearing ahead of the players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahead of you, you see a few sun rays breaking through the trees - a clearing. The roars are coming from that direction. "Raaaawwwwrrrr!!!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="meet-kimba"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#meet-kimba"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meet Kimba</h2>
<p>When the players approach, they'll see that the roars are coming from a crying child dragon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You come to the edge of the clearing. In the middle of it - holy pony, is that a dragon? Certainly looks like one - bronze skin, scales, wings - all there. Not a large one though, about the size of an elephant, it seems to be very young. It has curled up in the middle of a clearing. It notices you, slowly lifts his head, and howls. Strangely sad, heart-wrenching sound. Is it crying?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dragon's name is Kimba, and he's uncharacteristically low-spirited today.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/kimba.jpg" frame>
<h2 id="kimba"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#kimba"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Kimba</h2>
<p>Young dragon, like an 8 year old kid (think Simba, or Russel from "Up").</p>
<p>Always curious, chattering away.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>He's sad because the evil people took his mama:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="kimbas-story"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#kimbas-story"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Kimba's Story</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>"Are you here to take me, like they took my mama?"</p>
<hr/>
"They took my mama! The bad people! They took her away! I'm all alone now."  
<hr/>
"The warriors! In black armor, with big swords and spikes! She fought so hard to protect us, but they attacked her, and cast spells on her, and, and, and they captured her! And chained her, and put her in a cage, and took her away!"
<p>If the players offer to help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dragon looks at your faces, clearly confused. "You're so nice! My name is Kimba. My mom's name is Malinda. She's really kind and brave and strong! She's the best dragon."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="finding-the-city-of-lyra"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#finding-the-city-of-lyra"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Finding the City of Lyra</h2>
<p>Kimba doesn’t know where they took his mom, only the direction.</p>
<p>It's easy to find tracks left by the fight, and an army of warriors and wizards dragging the enchanted dragon into the city. Exploring around the forest will also reveal the road to the north, leading to the city.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the distance you see the city with tall walls of yellow stone and beautiful white towers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="yeti-hunters"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#yeti-hunters"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Yeti Hunters</h2>
<p>On their way to the city, the players will see a group of warriors delivering a huge iron cage to the city, inside - a gigantic Big Foot.</p>
<p>Leading the warriors is Edgar - the Captain of the Guards.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/edgar.png">
<h2 id="edgar-guard-captain"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#edgar-guard-captain"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Edgar (Guard Captain)</h2>
<p>The Captain of the Guards. Sick of his job, his honor makes him follow Cecilia's orders, but his common sense tells him that it's a horrible idea most of the time.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>The warriors can tell them that they're gathering creatures on Princess Cecilia's orders - the young princess likes watching monsters and gladiators fight her new dragon at the Coliseum in the center of the city.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="edgar"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#edgar"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Edgar</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>"We bring her monsters and eldritch creatures from far away lands. Many good men died on this quest. Once we're done with this Yeti, we are to bring our glorious Princess a Basilisk."</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>I hate my job</em>" he mutters to himself.</p>
<h2 id="getting-into-coliseum"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#getting-into-coliseum"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Getting into Coliseum</h2>
<p>There's a long queue of nobles on their way to watch the today's show (the spectacle is just for the rich). All entrances are guarded.</p>
<p>To get into the Coliseum, the players can fake being nobles, talk their way into the coliseum, bribe the guards, or try to sign up as Gladiators and go through The Pits (there's a scrawny teenager nearby giving away the "Join the Gladiators" fliers, nobody seems to want to take him up on that offer).</p>
<p>If the players come up with some other way in - that also works.</p>
<h2 id="the-pits"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-pits"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Pits</h2>
<p>If players choose to sign up as Gladiators - they'll see many captured people and monsters sitting in the cages in "The Pits" underneath the coliseum, forced to fight the dragon.</p>
<p>Cages are guarded by the City Guards, it's possible to steal the keys from them, liberate the gladiators/monsters, and incite the rebellion.</p>
<h2 id="coliseum-arena"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#coliseum-arena"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Coliseum Arena</h2>
<p><img src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/dragon2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the arena they will see a gigantic dragon, she is exhausted and wounded from many fights, desperately battling the newly delivered Yeti. The dragon has a heavy enchanted chain around her neck, visibly glowing purple and preventing her from spewing fire onto the stands and the guards.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/malinda.png">
<h2 id="malinda"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#malinda"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Malinda</h2>
<p>Mama dragon. Fierce and badass, but fair, gentle and loving with Kimba (Shirley Bennett).</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>The stands around the arena are filled with noblemen. There's a rich tent where Princess Cecilia, her guards, the Guard Captain Edgar, and her court wizard Alatar are sitting.</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/cecilia.png">
<h2 id="cecilia"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#cecilia"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Cecilia</h2>
<p>The "Evil Princess". Really, she's just a spoiled teenager, 13-14 years old. She never heard the word "no" in her life, and grew up surrounded by servants pampering her and indulging her every whim.</p>
<p>She sent countless men to die capturing the dragon just to have a pet.</p>
<p>Think Jasmine from Twisted.</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>Alatar holds a powerful-looking magic staff, its tip glowing with purple magic (the same color as the collar Malinda is wearing).</p>
<CharacterBox src="/post/damsels-and-dragons/alatar.png">
<h2 id="alatar"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#alatar"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Alatar</h2>
<p>An ancient court wizard, sycophant, always flatters the princess (Professor Farnsworth.)</p>
</CharacterBox>
<p>The princess is not irredeemably evil (just an incredibly spoiled kid), and can be convinced to let the dragon go with the right argument.</p>
<p>Edgar resents his position, he's tired of losing his friends and employees to the whims of this child, but sticks by Cecilia out of honor and loyalty. He can be convinced to take the player's side by appealing to reason and decency.</p>
<p>Alatar is a spineless wimp, he will follow whoever's in power at the moment.</p>
<p>Captain Edgar is a powerful warrior, Alatar is a powerful mage, but if it comes to combat they they can be defeated with great effort. If Alatar is distracted, the chain's magic weakens, and if he's defeated or the crystal in the magic staff is shattered, the chain breaks.</p>
<p>The King isn't present, he's currently conquering some far away kingdom, if something happens to the princess he will be furious.</p>
<h2 id="liberate-malinda"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#liberate-malinda"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Liberate Malinda</h2>
<p>Malinda is enraged, confused, shooting fire breath in random directions. Wants to murder everyone on the stands (mention that there are kids there), doesn't realize that players are there to help.</p>
<p>It's difficult to persuade a raging dragon. The players will need to find some way to get her attention and make it clear that they're trying to help. If the players took Kimba along with them and Malinda sees him, it will be much easier.</p>
<p>If it becomes clear that the players are trying to liberate the dragon - the guards, Edgar, and Alatar will attack.</p>
<p>If the players have liberated the Gladiators and persuaded them to incite the rebellion - they will help.</p>
<p>Once the chains are broken, Malinda will want to attack the audience.</p>
<p>She can be persuaded not to slaughter the people. She will be more willing to see reason if she learns that Kimba hasn't been harmed.</p>
<p>Once she's liberated and persuaded, she will be willing to let the players ride on her back and fly them out of the city.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-cave"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#dragon-cave"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Dragon Cave</h2>
<p>Kimba and Malinda are reunited and happy. Malinda will bestow valuable treasure onto the players from her hoard, and will be willing to help them out on future adventures.</p>

<p>Players enter a happy village, where everyone turns out to be mind-controlled by brain-slugs. The heroes will need to figure out what’s going on, find the path towards the center of the slug’s hive-mind, and destroy it (or make peace with it).</p>

<img src="/post/harmony/brain-slug-yeerk.png" alt="">
A vast sentient underground lake - the hivemind of mind-controlling slugs. Wants to bring about an "Apotheosis" (a global utopia) by taking control of all the minds. Speaks in creepy high-pitched sing-song voice. "We are Harmony. We bring joy and peace to all living beings."</p>

Local farmer. His family have been taken over by Harmony, and he stays in the village, pretenting to be mind-controlled, working on a plan to rescue them, collecting salt - the only substance Harmony is vulnerable to (get it? Because they're slugs).

<h2 id="entering-the-clearwater-village"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#entering-the-clearwater-village"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Entering the Clearwater Village</h2>
<p><img src="/post/harmony/village1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When traveling between locations, the players visit a lovely peaceful village.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re walking down a narrow road towards the Clearwater village. You’ve heard that people there need some help with a few chores, and figured that it sounds like a quiet and peaceful place to rest between the adventures while making a bit of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They meet a goofy old man welcoming them to the village.</p>
<div className="token"><img  src="/post/harmony/old-man-mcgucket.png"/></div> 
<blockquote>
<p>As you walk closer to the houses, you see an old man waving at you, he’s wearing a charming hat.<br>
<strong>Old Man McGuucket:</strong> Hey fellas! What brings you to Clearwater? Everyone calls me Old Man McGucket, how can I help cha?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they walk into the village, they see that everybody is extremely nice and welcoming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One unusual thing you notice is that all people here really love colorful hats - top-hats, cowboy hats, fedoras, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The players see the <strong>tavern</strong>, a *<strong>small church</strong>, an <strong>old windmill</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="tavern"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#tavern"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Tavern</h2>
<p><img src="/post/harmony/tavern.jpg" alt="">
Inside the tavern the players will see more friendly villagers, happy to welcome them and serve them food (they may notice that the food is surprisingly bland, and there's no salt around).</p>
<p>Players will one person, without a hat, running away, but the guards quickly apprehend him, claiming he's a murderer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see some sort of commotion from the window. You see a man running away from two guards “Hey, get him!”. By the time you’re outside, you see them carrying him, unconscious, back in the direction of the prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later they see him wearing a hat.</p>
<p>The people in the tavern will get more and more insistent in inviting the players to check out their basement, where they have a ""great selection of foods and wines"".</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-slugs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#discovering-the-slugs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Discovering the Slugs</h2>
<div className="token"><img  src="/post/harmony/posessed-villager.png"/></div> 
<p>If players capture a person and remove the hat, they see a green slug underneath it. If they remove the slug, the person falls on the floor and starts crying, thanking them for his freedom. It is revealed that everyone in the village is controlled by psychic brain-slugs, attached to their heads, wearing hats as a disguise (ratatouille-style). Players can also be ambushed by a group of villagers trying to assimilate them.</p>
<p>Gradually it becomes clear that things aren't so black and white - the slug hive-mind (calling itself Harmony) is trying to "bring peace and joy to all the living creatures", to build a utopia. Turning murderers and alcoholics into productive members of society, curing the depression of a suicidal person(by controlling their thoughts), etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-windmill"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-windmill"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Windmill</h2>
<p>At the windmill they will see the Friendly Frank - local farmer who has been pretending to be mind-controlled (by wearing a hat), gathering salt, preparing to fight off the invasion.</p>
<h2 id="small-church"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#small-church"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Small Church</h2>
<p>At the church players will meet Father Lucius. He will give them a moralizing speech, tell them about the upcoming apotheosis, and, depending on how the players react, is likely to ring a church bell summoning the villagers to assmilate the players.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-well"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-old-well"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Old Well</h2>
<div className="token"><img  src="/post/harmony/well.jpg"/></div> 
The center of the hive-mind (the vast underground sentient lake) resides underneath the old waterless well. 
<p>Players can find it by following one of the villagers (the brain slugs have to leave their hosts once every few days to feed), or by liberating one of the mind-controlled villagers and asking them.</p>
<h3 id="underneath-the-well"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#underneath-the-well"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Underneath the Well</h3>
<p>Players descend into the well, find a bunch of tunnels, mind-controlled giant spiders and centepedes, and a vast underground lake glowing with eerie emerald green color - Harmony, the coalescion of brain-slugs, the main hive-mind.</p>
<p>Harmony will tell players that it is thousands of years old, for most of it's existence the slugs could only posess the local creatures (giant spiders, rats, centipedes). It can't think or see on it's own, it can only use the intelligence and senses of the hosts. After the well has ran out of water, the villagers have descended to investigate, it was able to posess one of them, and that was the first time it had access to human-level intelligence. It will say comes in peace and wants to bring about a utopia.</p>
<p>The lake can be destroyed by pouring the bags of salt the Friendly Frank has been collecting at his windmill (In case of a fight, Harmony can tell the spiders/rats/centipedes to attack). They can also try to persuade Harmony to leave (like in The World's End), or try to find some path to symbiosis.</p>
<h2 id="resolution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resolution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h2>
<p>Depending on what happens at the lake, Harmony can become the player's ally, or the villagers will thank and reward them for their liberation (except for the villagers who liked the symbiosis).</p>

<p>This adventure was made by the <a href="https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room">Adventure Writer's Room</a> community. We are a group of GMs who meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment. It works, it really helps with the writing, and it is super fun.</p>
<p>We're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!</p>]]></content:encoded>
