## Playtest Actual Play Youtube invite
```
**Looking for 2-3 friendly people who like improvisation and freeform roleplay, and want to participate in a lighthearted one-shot adventure on my Actual Play youtube channel.**

**System:** Mirage (https://rpgadventures.io/mirage)
**Platform:** Discord Video Chat.
**Time:** We'll play tomorrow (June 10th) at 2PM BST. We'll be aiming for a 2-3 hour session. 
**Players:** Looking for 2-3 players.
**Format:**  Lighthearted one-shot focused on storytelling/improvisation/roleplay.
**Requirements:** Webcam. Also, the game is completely PG-13 and SFW, but you gotta be 18 or older to participate (since all players are grown ups).

Hey, everyone! Who wants to participate in an actual play one-shot for my youtube channel? 

I'm just getting started, it is a very small, low-production-value, low-expectations experiment. I just think it would be fun to upload the games I'm running to youtube - so we wouldn't just be playing, but also creating something neat we can share with people. You can see one of our previous games here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn9vV_wHpY4

We will play over the discord video chat (so you do need a webcam to participate), roll the dice in the discord text chat, and after the game I'll upload the video to youtube.

The system we'll be using to play is called Mirage -  it is a roleplaying/storytelling/improv focused game, a very simple and minimalistic set of rules for basicaly freeform roleplay. You can learn the rules and create your character in under 15 minutes.
 
Novice players are welcome! We'll start simple, and get better as we go along. I'm hoping to find some friendly people who are interested in learning and growing together. If you want to experiment with this sort of thing, learn how it's done, and can be patient if things go wrong - you're welcome to join the game!

If that sounds like fun send me a message, learn how to play (https://rpgadventures.io/mirage), and create your character.

## Does server allow brainstorming recruitment?
Sent:
- TableTopArcade (no)
```
Hey guys! I'm new to this server, I want to ask you a couple of things.

I'm running adventure brainstorming sessions - a group of GMs meet in the discord voice chat, and we challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. By the end of the session we usually have an adventure we can playtest or run for our players.

Since I need at least 3-4 people for a session, I'm looking for a place where I can find good GMs (or players who want to learn how to create adventures) who'd be interested in this sort of thing.

My questions are:
1. Do you guys have a players/GMs recruitment channel?
2. Is it acceptable here to invite people to sessions that happen outside of this server?
3. If not, can you recommend some good discord communities where I could find some friendly and creative GMs/players to brainstorm with me?
