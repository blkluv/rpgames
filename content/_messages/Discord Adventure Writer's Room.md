## Session Announcement
```
Hey, @everyone! Who's free to do some brainstorming at [time and date]?

We will try to make a [short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure set in a fantasy world (feel free to replace this with your own adventure type and genre)].

We will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes they go as long as 3 hours.

I'm looking for 3-4 people. If you can join us - leave a message in this chat.

If you aren't familiar with our process or haven't read the guidelines yet - please read this post before we start our session: https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room
```
```
> Also, today I want to screencast our brainstorming process and upload it to youtube. We don't need to do anything differently, I just want to be able to share our process with other people. If at the end of the session anyone isn't comfortable with uploading the video, I'll delete it.
```

> In the google doc go to Tools > Preferences, and uncheck “Automatically Detect Lists”, otherwise google docs autoformatting will be really annoying.

And open our adventure prompts tool:

We will use it to help us generate some ideas for our adventure.

## After brainstorm
```
Hey, thanks a lot for participating in the brainstorm! It's been really fun brainstorming with you, I'd love to see you in our future sessions.

Also, please let me know if you have any feedback - any thoughts on what I could do better, how I could improve the process, whether you found anything difficult or confusing, what you think worked well and what didn't, etc. That would be really helpful for making our future sessions better!
