**Adventure Writers' Room - GMs Brainstorming Adventures Together**

We are a group of GMs who love creating adventures for tabletop roleplaying games.

We help each other to brainstorm ideas and create stories for our players to enjoy.

If you're a Game Master trying to create cool adventures for your players, or a writer looking to learn how to write adventures - you will probably find our community very useful!

We have:

- **Brainstorming Sessions**  
    Participate in our adventure brainstorming sessions and develop fun ideas. 
    > A group of GMs meet in the discord voice chat, and we challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment. It's super fun, it works, and it really helps with creating adventures! Usually, by the end of the brainstorming session, we have a solid outline of an adventure we can run for our players. Learn more about how this works [here](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room).

- **Playtests**  
Find beta-players who will help you to playtest your adventures, or participate in fun playtests to help others!
- **Adventure Writing Help and Feedback**  
We're happy to help you with the adventure writing process or brainstorming ideas. If you have no experience creating adventures - we'll help you get started!
- **GMing Advice**  
Share and discuss GMing tips and advice.
- **Story Games**  
We also play Story Games and Improv games designed to help Game Masters to get better at storytelling, improvisation, and roleplay.

**Weâ€™re looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!**


If you want to improvise some stories with us - come join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D)!

GMing experience will be helpful, but is not required. You're welcome to join even if you've never GMd before, as long as you enjoy storytelling and want to learn how to create adventures.
