Hey, thanks for messaging me! Sure, you're welcome to join!

Come join our discord:

We'll be brainstorming in the `Brainstorming Voice` channel.
Before we begin, please take a look at how our process works (https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room), and let me know if you have any questions.

(But don't worry if anything is confusing or unclear, you'll quickly pick it up during the session, and we'll be happy to help you get started.)

Hey, thanks for reaching out!

I'm trying to run our sessions around 8PM GMT on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but I'm likely to switch the time occasionally, so that people from different timezones have an opportunity to participate. Also as our community grows, I hope that we'll have more people who can run the sessions, and then they'll be available in other timezones as well.

Read this post to learn how our brainstorming process works: https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room
And if that sounds interesting, come join our server: https://discord.gg/UVNxeQE

Keep an eye on `#session-announcements` channel for notifications about upcoming brainstorms.
Let me know if you have any questions!
