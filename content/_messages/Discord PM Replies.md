## You can join Brainstorm
```
Hey, thanks for messaging me! Sure, you're welcome to join!

Come join our discord:
https://discord.com/invite/UVNxeQE

We'll be brainstorming in the `Brainstorming Voice` channel.
Before we begin, please take a look at how our process works (https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room), and let me know if you have any questions.

(But don't worry if anything is confusing or unclear, you'll quickly pick it up during the session, and we'll be happy to help you get started.)

Hey, thanks for reaching out!

I'm trying to run our sessions around 8PM GMT on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but I'm likely to switch the time occasionally, so that people from different timezones have an opportunity to participate. Also as our community grows, I hope that we'll have more people who can run the sessions, and then they'll be available in other timezones as well.

Read this post to learn how our brainstorming process works: https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room
And if that sounds interesting, come join our server: https://discord.gg/UVNxeQE

Keep an eye on `#session-announcements` channel for notifications about upcoming brainstorms.
Let me know if you have any questions!

## Out of spots for brainstorm
Hey, thanks for reaching out!

I think we're already out of spots, but if someone doesn't show up - you're welcome to join.

You can also join one of our future sessions. I am trying to run these sessions twice per week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Come join our server and keep an eye on #session-announcements, and you'll be able to join the next one:
