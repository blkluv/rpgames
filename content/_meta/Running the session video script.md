# Adventure Brainstorming
Hello! In this video I will give you a quick overview of our brainstorming process. 

Our goal is to create a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure. We will brainstorm ideas, and develop them into an outline of the story that gives us all the information we need to run the game for our players.

If we really like the story we have created, we can turn it into a complete adventure, publish it on our website, and share it with our community.

We will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes they go as long as 3 hours, depending on how much time we have, and how much enthusiasm we have for the ideas we came up with.

The person who has announced the session becomes a session guide. Their job is to do their best to make sure that we successfully create a good adventure within a reasonable amount of time. They will be trying to guide the brainstorming process, keep our conversation on track, and keep us going forward at a good pace.

# Before the Session
Before the the session, we take turns giving quick introductions. Share a bit about who you are, what should we call you, and what brings you here.

[Then we discuss the genre we want our adventure to be in.]

Open the documents the session guide has posted in the brainstorming text channel: Brainstorming template, adventure idea generator, and the adventure prompts tool.

Hey, everyone! Thanks a lot for joining, this is gonna be fun!

## Introductions
Lets start with brief introductions.

- What should we call you?
- How long have you been playing?
- What brings you here, why did you decide to participate?
<!-- What kind of rpg are you playing and how long? -->

I'll start:

> I go by Lumen. I've been roleplaying for a couple of years. I was struggling to create adventures for my games, so I've made this community because I was hoping that surrounding myself with creative people would help me out, and it really did.

Add your names at the top of the file.




We will go through the template step by step, fill it with our ideas, build on top of each other's ideas, discuss and pick our favorite ones, and try to turn them into a story, an outine of the adventure that gives us all the information we need to run it for our players.


### Session guide role


### Screencastig

I like to screencast our sessions and upload them to youtube. It's useful for people and helps me grow our community.

But we don't have to do this if anyone doesn't feel comfortable with that. If at the end of the session anyone isn't comfortable with uploading the video, I'll delete it.

### New approach
1. Pick a primary objective, the thing our olayers will try to accomplish during this adventure
2. Pick a secondary objective from another category. The thing we need to do to accomplish the primary objective.
3. Pick a difficulty from one of 3 categories. Deal with a constraint, villain does something, or we need to solve a mystery.
4. Do it 3 times, and pick the goal we like the most.


### Using the adventure prompts tool
First will use the adventure prompts tool, to help us come up with the initial premise for our adventure. We will take turns pitching the ideas based on prompts. We'll talk about them, build on top of them, recombine them, and pick our favorite one.

Don't forget to choose the genre!

I'll start, just to give you an example. Here are the prompts I have. Now Ill try to pitch an adventure based on them in about 3 minutes.


# Outro
### Feedback
Anything I could do better?
