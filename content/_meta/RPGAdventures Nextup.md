>> RPGA is solved:
- Weekly Saturday Brainstorms, Wednesday Playtests. 6PM GMT.
- Complete and publish adventures.
- Go through my course, post about my steps, give feedback to others.
This is also the best way to keep the community active. 
And to create my own adventures I can do with as I please.
- Growth: 
	- Invite discord people to brainstorms.
	- Invite r/lfg people to playtests.
	- Share adventures on subreddits.
	- Publish brainstorm screencasts and playtests to youtube.
- Monetization:
	- Share course for free to grow and engage the community.
	- Once I have iterated, perfected the course, and have too many people,
	- start charging for it.
	- Copyright safe images are made from photoshopping shutterstock images (or drawing illustrations in my own artstyle, but it'd be too slow and low leverage, or paying people for licensing or photoshopping.)

Adventure Writing Academy (my course that will teach you a straightforward step-by-step system for creating awesome one-shot adventures),  will be free for the next month. Come participate!
Hey everyone! I have spent the last 1.5 years writing [one-shot adventures] and trying to come up with a straightforward step-by-step system that helps me to do his productively. I have also been running brainstorming sessions where a group of GMs meet in a discord voice chat, and create an adventure in 2-3 hours.

Now I have summarized everything I have learned about creating adventures, and published a [course]. In the future I'm planning to sell it for $50, but for the next month I want to share it with people for free (to get feedback that will help me to improve the course, practice guiding people through the writing process).

Besides learning the process for creating the course you will:
-  Get access to adventure brainstorming and writing templates that make the whole process much faster and simpler.
- A really cool and powerful adventure prompts tool I have developed, which will help you to come up with endless adventure ideas.
 [and wst]. 
 - Participate in our friendly, creative, and supportive community who will help you to develop your ideas and finish your one-shot adventure.
 - Participate in our brainstorming sessions where we will create some cool adventures together.
 - The first 10 people who begin the course, complete the first section about brainstorming ideas, and post these ideas in our community will get personal feedback and guidance on making the adventures from me (I'll do my best to help everyone else as well, but that will depend on the amount of time and number of students we'll have).
 
The course is entirely free, no strings attached. Though if you do get value from it, I'd really appreciate it if you shared it with your friends (or on social media), and sent me some feedback.

>> Move it to nexy. Build a community. Write some blog posts too. I could outright let people publish and sell their adventures (pdfs plus the text under cut), Ive already got all the places from GA. And use it as wst marketing channel, and sell the course.

Pitch running your own sessions:
"For this community to be active and successful, we need to run regular brainstorming sessions, at least twice per week. I am doing my best to do this, but I don't always have the time or the mental health to run these sessions. So I'm looking for people who can run them as well. We need a criticsl mass to have enougn people to run sessions and teach others to run these sessions, so that eventually the community becomes self sustsining snd theres enough people capable of doing this stuff.

Im SO fuckig doing this once wst is done and Im at a better spot in my life.
