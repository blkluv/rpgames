A GM makes a list of 3-5 challenges the players have to overcome to defeat the enemy (main powers/defenses the enemy has).
> - Dragon can fly and is hard to reach.
> - Dragon has sharp claws and tail.
> - Dragon's scales provide him strong armor.
> - Dragon's fire breath makes him difficult to approach.

To overcome each challenge, the players must successfully complete 3 phases:
- Deal with the enemy attack. 
- Maneuver allies and enemies into position.
- Attack the enemy and put them on the defensive.

All 3 phases take place at the same time. The players describe together how they take coordinated action, and make their rolls.

A player can take the lead on one of the problems, or help out another player. The player can't deal with 2 problems at once.

If any roll succeeds, play moves to the next phase. If no roll succeeds, the lowest rolling player takes a hit. If a player takes two hits, they are out.

Enemies act when you fail. 

And if you have problems with wanting to roll for specific actions, maybe think in broader sense. Don't think about rolling for landing a specific punch, but for the effect of knocking someone out.

## Problems
I found myself struggling to ask players to roll for noticing things or reading people.
- Roll to see how sneaky you're being.
- Roll to see if you can read something about him.
- Roll to see if you can notice something in this room.
[Solutions](https://old.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/sjzsoe/how_do_you_ask_players_to_roll_for_a_specific/)
- Maybe give them some hints like a mysterious sound. So like what Harry Potter does with the clues, be subtle about it.
> So instead of asking them to roll for insight, I'd be dropping obvious clues, and creating a mystery about the NPCs strange behavior. The players can't fail to notice that something is off, but to figure out what it is, they have to investigate.
> Just be subtle about it and give vague hints that prompt players to roll. Describe the situation where they are naturally inclined to be cautious, or to try to figure out whether the character is lying to them.
> What I do is very carefully describe the situation and expect players to intervene. If they are entering a tunnel with a trap or crossing a dangerous bridge, I am very careful to describe the bridge as rickety and ancient or the tunnel as dark and narrow. I feed the players a tone and an atmosphere for the place well in advance of their getting there. They know they are going into the sun goddess’ dungeon and that she’s into blood sacrifices, and the entrance to the place is piled high with human skulls. I ask them explicitly, Okay, do you step into the tunnel? Or Okay, who is walking across the bridge first? In the case of the dark alley where they are being followed, I describe the alleyway as “strangely silent except for the echo of distant footsteps” or “eerily quiet except for the occasional rustle of leaves” and continue to feed them atmospheric clues as they proceed.
> In this case it’s about leaving enough clues for any reasonable person to pick up on. You want the players to pick up on it, so you can be pretty obvious with the description.
- Just let the dramatically appropriate thing happen. Does it make sense? Would it be useful to make the story move forward? How them noticing or not would make them feel? If you want to surprise the players, just do it
- Literally tell them "roll to notice something in the forest" or "roll to gain some insight about this guy".
- Just tell them a bear is stalking them through the woods and ask them to roll to see if they notice it. Remember, rolling dice exists to determine which of two or more INTERESTING outcomes happens. If you're rolling between "something interesting happens" and "nothing interesting happens" then you didn't need to roll for it.
- Get a list of your players' talents and then decide yourself if they apply to the check every time. Telling one of the team that they call roll with advantage while the others can’t adds even more mystique to the roll.
- If the player didn't say he's looking for it, he just doesn't. And the whatever gets the ambush. If the player isn't suspecting a lie, he does not roll. If he asks if the other person is telling the truth, he can roll with his talents. Put that agency in the hand of the players and be clear about such things in session 0. So everyone is on the same page. Wait till the players choose to do something. If they want to do something which you think needs a roll, THEN they need to roll, and you just ask them to roll for it with the skills they think are appropriate. If they wander through a city at night and a thief follows them but they don't check... Then they didn't checked.
> Rolling should be reserved for the character who makes an effort. If the NPC follows the party, he rolls a check, if a charactr actively scanning the environment, he can contest it.
- literally tell them "roll to notice something in the forest" or "roll to gain some insight about this guy".

Combat.
It ended up defaulting to players taking turns, and rolling for specific actions.

Flip the roll and explanation. Usually as a GM you ask them what they do and then ask them to roll. Don’t ask them what they are doing, just ask them to roll. Then ask them to explain the result they got (who hit whom and what happened).

Getting too complicated.

- Number of successes defines the degree of success.
- You can require more than 1 success in extreme cases.

You don't need to roll to see whether you can use an ability - you can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun. But you may still need to roll for an outcome - whether your fireball or a grappling hook hits its aim.

Sucessfully using an ability doesn't require a roll - a player can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun. An ability simply gives them the power to do the thing it's describing throughout the story. But they may still need to roll for the outcome - whether the fireball hits its aim.


The exception is when you intentionally design an ability to have a limitation that makes it unpredictable. Like a gun that backfires when you roll below 5.

Unlike talents, abilities don't give you advantage on rolls - they give you a narrative permission to do the extraordinary thing they are describing.

- Add a Maeloki mechanic that codifies that players can contribute aspects to the world. Or just put it into thr roleplaying guidelines, dont be afraid to add things to the story?
- Do abilities auto-succeed? Do they just give you the narrative permission + advantage on a roll?
- Add scifi abilities list.
>> Abilities don't require a roll in order to work, but you may need to roll to see the effect of an ability. You can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun, but you may need to roll for it to hit its aim.

Powers/items can give you advantage, or allow you to do things you wouldn’t be able to without them (to climb a tree you need a rope).
allows you to do
something you wouldn’t be able to do without it� For example, if you want to scale a wall, you might need rope, or a grappling hook.
choose something in real life and draw power from it. For instance, your magic might draw traits from whatever a cell phone could do.
Dont always have to make the player roll to use the abilities, only the difficult ones.
pyromancer—a trait that is drawing on whatever
a flamethrower could do� 
Draw on the power of animals, machines, tools and more.
Target: information, people, creatures, specific material.
Weight
Size
Distance. Close/near/far.
Line of sight
Amount of force you can apply.
Unpredictable (dangerous) - roll the dice, pay the cost on failure. puts you in danger. Dangerous - has a chance to backfire or have the opposite of the intended effect.
Costs. Expensive - without the money/mana/vt to track it? 
Consumable. Or requires ammo.
Area of effect - splash (affects everything around the target, affects everything near the caster).
Requires training/attunement.
Requires a sacrifice? Single use items/potions.
Heavy/unwieldy - a huge thing you have to carry with two hands, can't hide or make discrete.
Time - takes time to activate, can be activated once per scene/day (has a cooldown), how long it lasts.
Fragile - on failure it breaks and cant be used until fixed.
Attracts attention. Flashy, makes noise, requires you to perform specific actions. Loud, bright, some other obvious effect.
Jackpot - has no need for a roll, always works.
Circumstances - can only use it when youre in danger. 
Negative consequences of some kind? 
Specificity. Make fountain out of a tree.
Compare to regular power/object. Run twice as fast, jump 10 times farther, enoarge 4x the size.

Style: Lasers and feelings.
Alien, Android, dangerous, heroic, hot shot, intreoid, savvy. Fast, nimble.
Role: Doctor, envoy, engineer, explorer, pilot, scientist, soldier.
ship:
Superior senses, cloaking device.

Fuel hog, horrible circuits, grim reputation.
Weaknesses,
Character goal - become captain, meet new aliens, etc,
number from 2 to 5. Technology vs intuition.
