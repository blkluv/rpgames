# Intro
Relaxed, confident, excited.

Hey, everyone! Thanks a lot for joining, this is gonna be fun!

## Introductions
Lets start with brief introductions.

- What should we call you?
- How long have you been playing?
- What brings you here, why did you decide to participate?
<!-- What kind of rpg are you playing and how long? -->

I'll start:

> I go by Lumen. I've been roleplaying for a couple of years. I was struggling to create adventures for my games, so I've made this community because I was hoping that surrounding myself with creative people would help me out, and it really did.

## Technical
Do you have the google doc and adventure prompts tool open? 

Add your names at the top of the file.

## Process Recap
### Goal, session time, process
So our goal is to create a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure that any of us can run for our players.

We will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes it goes as long as 3 hours, depending on how much time we have, and how much we like the idea we came up with.

We will go through the template step by step, fill it with our ideas, build on top of each other's ideas, discuss and pick our favorite ones, and try to turn them into a story, an outine of the adventure that gives us all the information we need to run it for our players.

If we really like the story we have created, and have about 40 minutes of time left, we can try creating a one-page adventure out of it, which we then share with our community.

### Session guide role
My job as a session guide is to do my best to make sure that we successfully create a good adventure within a reasonable amount of time. So I will be trying to guide the brainstorming process, keep our conversation on track, and keep us going forward at a good pace.

### Using the adventure prompts tool
First will use the adventure prompts tool, to help us come up with the initial premise for our adventure. We will take turns pitching the ideas based on prompts. We'll talk about them, build on top of them, recombine them, and pick our favorite one.

Don't forget to choose the genre!

I'll start, just to give you an example. Here are the prompts I have. Now Ill try to pitch an adventure based on them in about 3 minutes.


# Outro
### Invite people to run sessions
I really want our server to have an active community and regular brainstorming sessions, but my time is very limited. I want to encourage everyone to.
