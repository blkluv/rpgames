Running Playtest document.
- Quick introductions.
- Quick expectations? Lighthearted, roleplay-focused.
- Introduce your characters. You're a part of the party, establish the relationships, how did you guys meet, you guys know each other. 
- Try roling the dice to make sure it works for everyone (copy paste the template).
- Ask about screencasting (in the chat).
And then just jump into it!

End:
- Did you guys enjoy the session? Any feedback on the adventure, or on the mirage system?
- On this server we're running brainstorming sessions, where a group of GM meets in the discord chat for a couple of hours, and we make adventures like this one. Youre welcome to participate!
