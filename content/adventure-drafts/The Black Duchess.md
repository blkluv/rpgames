- Start in the forest? What are they doing in there?
- Meet old drew
- Follow the scent/animals towards the tree
- See delapidated town, most buildings half ruined, but others are being rebuilt by big lumbering creatures. Factory is expanding. A lot of construction is going on. Creatures are wearing the iron helmet devices.
- See the tree in front of the factory. Root system connected to it. Tries to lure you in. Lures one player into its hollow, puts them onto the disassembly line.
- Players try to survive the disassembly line, or rescue the person that's on it. See a bunny in front of you picked up by a tentacle, dipped into purple goo, comes out twice as large with spider legs.
- Cages with animals. See igor picking up a wolf and carrying it upstairs. Do you want me to take you to dr grimwork?
- Meet Igor, big lumbering monster, part human, part bear. Literally an assistant. Oh, you're here to see The Black Duchess? Come right in.
- Oh, he's like a captialist/salesman. He's excited to meet the heroes, a new clients welcome welcome!
	Oh, this? This is our new top of the line batlift, it will deliver even the heaviest of objects to any construction site.
	Look, these bats are valuable assets, I can't just give them away willy nilly. I can sell them to you, just add your name to the waiting list, and my sales department will contact you shortly. I can offer you a discount, as our first customers.
- Walk up the tower to the lab.
## Intro
It is a dark and stormy night. You have been traveling through the Romanian forests for many days. You're drenched, and exhausted, and probably lost. Flashes of litghtning are the only thing illuminating the [adjective] path anead of you, the wind is howling so loudly that you can barely hear yourself think. What's going through your head as you trudge through the forest?
Between thunder, in the distance, you hear a voice calling out [bat names].
Perceptive ones roll the dice.
Another flash of lightning illuminates the path ahead, and you see a sihlouette, right in front of you. The creature seems humanoid, with a pair of gigantic bat wings sprouting from its back.


## Meet the Old Drew

# Talk to the tree
You know what, being sucked into the root system IS pretty neat, that's a solid idea. 
So the tree has been designed by this dude, it's a tool he uses to capture creatures. It's sentient, whatever, it's half tree half animal.
Tentalizing fruit and all is fun. But we wanted it to have social interaction.
HEEY! If they come closer, they inhale it's scent, which takes them on a paychoactive trip.
What does the tree say?
Pleasant silky voice.
Does it convince you to take a rest?
Eat its fruit? Take a rest?
Can it answer your questions?
The person who reaches our for the fruit just plain gets stuck, the flower closes around their hand, trapping them. Yeah, that is SOLID.
Hello travellers. I am the giving tree, lovely to see you in these lands.
Actually try to be convincing.
Have you seen the bats?
What would it say?
Yes, of course, I gave them my fruit and sent them off on their way.
Do you want to try my fruit? It's delicious.
Do you not like me?
Its just that I stand here, century after century, producing the fruit. I can use it to feed the animals, but people rarely come by.
It begins to cry.
Yeah, dont make it obvious that the tree is evil, literally do my best to convince the players that it's just a giving tree.
It closes the flower around your hand, the tendrils sprout, it drags you underneath. 
They either defeat it or not, but Ill do my best to drag at least one of the players under.
What else? The players who are outside need to follow them.
Ideally, the player gets sucked in, then they have to be rescued from the conveyor belt.
If they all manage to escape somehow...
Maybe the tree goes "You jerks! Guess what, my master will turn your prescious bats into meat real soon."
And then they just plain notice the castle behind the tree.
Okay, that's also extremely solid.
Maybe the player on the conveyor belt feels drowsy.
[skin bark]

## In the factory
Alriht, they're in the factory,
Picture it, what do I see, how do I describe this?
Walking past enormous castle gates.
Tesla factory of efficiency.
Conveyor belts, with tentacles manipulating them.
Maybe attached to like a huge optic nerve.
Speaking of optic nerve, theres one gigantic eye.
AInof the factory is like one huge octopus machine.
Centipedes are invokved somehow.
Anythincg creepy thst csn be involved in the production line.
Zombies stitched together? For sure!
One zombie has gigantic praying mantis mendables instead of the arms!
Another one uses his face to just...
There's like an eyeball on a stem that examines the products.
What do the products look like?
Creepy animals mixed with factory products is the idea.
Oh shit a car but with legs instead of the wheels! Amazing.
Some mind of war machine.
- Zombies being assembled
- Quadriped wolves with a human arm instead of the face (like spot).
- There's an organic looking  car with 6 human legs instead of the 4 wheels.
- Gigantic mosquitos/dragonflys with buzzsaws attached to their tail.
- Theres a baby deer
- Wolf
- Bear
- Spiders?
- Fish?
So you're beig transported down the conveyor belt, and the bunny in front of you is... picked apart? Dipped into the vat?
Ah, it's one conveyor belt, but octopus AI decides whether to disassemble you or mutate you...
So in front ofnyou is a deer, something glued to its back.
Squirts purple goo, it grows 6 more eyes. Glues a goat's head to the back of its torso. And centaur like human arms.
Bunny is dipped into the sludge by a tentacle. Comes out like a long hairy centipede. 


- How do I take the players upstairs?
- More on how Igor factors in.
- More details about the climax. Maybe break the combat encounter into stages.
- Original purpose for players being there?
Somehow incorporate lightning into it.
