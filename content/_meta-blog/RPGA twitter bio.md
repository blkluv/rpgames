Hey guys! We're a community of GMs who create adventures together (and share them with everyone for free). We're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!

I also share storytelling/roleplaying/improv tips and advice, and exciting ideas you can use in your games.

I'm working on Mirage - a rules-light game for people who love storytelling, improvisation, and freeform roleplay.

My goal is to get the rules out of your way, so that you can focus on roleplaying and getting better at storytelling and improv.
