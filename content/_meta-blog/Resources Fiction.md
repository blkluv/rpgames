Mann Shorts: [https://www.youtube.com/c/MannShorts]

Comedy:DnD Shorts [https://www.youtube.com/c/DnDShorts](https://www.youtube.com/c/DnDShorts) This channel focuses on 1-2 minute clips, with the recent content focusing on some hilarious things you can do in 5E.

Mann Shorts [https://www.youtube.com/c/MannShorts](https://www.youtube.com/c/MannShorts) This channel has several different skits for various series. One shots lasting 10 minutes (all skits, not true one shots)

Viva La Dirt League [https://www.youtube.com/c/VivaLaDirtLeague](https://www.youtube.com/c/VivaLaDirtLeague) This channel isn't exactly D&D focused, but if you like D&D, you'll like these sketches. I will mention their second channel that is entirely D&D below.

Viva La Dirt League D&D [https://www.youtube.com/c/VivaLaDirtLeagueDnD](https://www.youtube.com/c/VivaLaDirtLeagueDnD) This is LVDL's D&D focused channel. Skits are here, and there is a campaign based on the NPC characters from their main channel.

Puffin Forest [https://www.youtube.com/c/puffinforest](https://www.youtube.com/c/puffinforest) Doesn't upload very frequently, but I love his animations, and worth a watch.

Optimization/Guides

Bilbrons & Dragons [https://www.youtube.com/c/DD5ePowergamersTacticsRoom](https://www.youtube.com/c/DD5ePowergamersTacticsRoom) As the URL might imply, this is someone that optimizes his characters very well. This channel and the next 2 I mention are perhaps the most detailed channels I've found that really go into the weeds as far as getting the absolute most out of your characters.

Treantmonk's Temple [https://www.youtube.com/c/TreantmonksTemple](https://www.youtube.com/c/TreantmonksTemple) Admittedly, his voice is soothing and may put you asleep, but the details and breakdowns are fantastic.

Pack Tactics [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC--uK3pNia6R-qauWvsAZng](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC--uK3pNia6R-qauWvsAZng) If you have limited time, and want the condensed version for optimization, Pack Tactics is the way to go. Short and informative.

Dungeon Dudes [https://www.youtube.com/c/DungeonDudes](https://www.youtube.com/c/DungeonDudes) The channel has been mentioned many times previously in this thread and for good reason. They produce quality content in a variety of topics in an easy to digest format.

Hook and Chance [https://www.youtube.com/c/HookandChance](https://www.youtube.com/c/HookandChance) This is not really a video, but I felt it worth including because they really deserve subs. This is a podcast that covers a lot of 5E content on a lot of D&D content that gets glossed over by a lot of channels/media.

Web DM [https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDM](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDM) I only recently found this channel and some of it is hit or miss. Appears like the format for their older content and newer content is a little different. Worth at least a check into though.

TheD&DLogs [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDDLogs](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDDLogs) If you like Top 10 lists, this is the channel for you. Not much else to say about it.

EDIT: Nerdarchy [https://www.youtube.com/c/Nerdarchy](https://www.youtube.com/c/Nerdarchy) I forgot this one. A little more long winded than Dungeon Dudes, but they cover a few topics that get missed by Dungeon Dudes, so worth looking through their previous videos.

## Improv YouTube Channels
[Made Up Theatre](https://www.youtube.com/c/MadeUpTheatre/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) - At the moment of writing, the MUT tips series has up to 120 videos that are usually up to 10 minutes long. So there is A LOT of content, and a good chance something there suits your needs.
