Hey, @everyone! Quick announcement. I wrote a course where I share everything I know about writing adventures. For the next couple of months, it will be freely available to everyone in this community:
https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy

This course will guide you, step-by-step, through the process of creating an awesome one-shot adventure (like the ones you see on our website). If you take one step per day (each step is meant to take under 30 minutes), you will have completed your own adventure in two weeks.

The course will be much more fun and useful if several people go through it at the same time - as we take the steps, we will help each other to brainstorm ideas, exchange feedback, keep each other motivated to complete the adventure, and make some friends along the way =)

I myself will start going through the course next Monday, January 17th. I will share all my progress, and do my best to help everyone who decides to go through the course with me. If you want to participate - leave a message in this chat.

If you write a good adventure - you can publish it on our website (If you want you can share it for free or sell it, it's up to you).

I could launch it on dndadventurewriter, it's small enough.
