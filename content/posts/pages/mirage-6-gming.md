# Running the Game

As a GM, your goal is to create a fun story together with your players. Describe the world around the players, play the role of the NPCs, establish the challenge the heroes will face next, narrate the consequences of their actions.

To play the game you need an adventure. Find a list of premade adventures you can run for your players [here](/), learn how to create your own [here](/course/adventure-academy), or participate in our [adventure brainstorming sessions](/writers-room) where a group of GMs create a fun adventure together.

<!--
Works only for playtesting where everyone already knows the adenture.

## Collaborative GMing (Optional)
If several players want to try their hand at running the game, we can take turns GMing the scenes for each other.

One person temporarily becomes a GM, everyone else plays as their character. The current GM runs the game until we switch and someone else continues the story.

If the current GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can ask other players for suggestions, or tap out and let someone else continue the story.

<!-- 
Before the game, help the players to understand the rules and create their characters.

During the game, tell players what’s going on around them, ask them what they want to do, and then use your imagination, common sense, and results of dice rolls to describe consequences.

Give the players a task to accomplish (find the treasure, defeat a monster, save the princess). Put challenges on their path, obstacles to getting what they want. Watch them find creative ways to overcome them.

Imagine how the world responds to their actions, create and describe interesting consequences, add fun complications. Play the role of all NPCs like an actor, respond to what the players do the way these characters would respond.

Try to bring the story to an awesome, dramatic, satisfying conclusion. Like an epic climactic showdown with the antagonist. Watch the heroes overcome their biggest challenge and reach their goal.

## Rolling Dice (for GMs)
Before the roll, set the target number the player needs to beat in order to succeed at a task. Set lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. 5 is easy, 10 is standard, 15 is challenging, 18 is very hard.

### Rare rolls, meaningful consequences
Tell the players to roll only when both succeeding and failing at an action could each contribute something interesting to the story. The situation should always change after a roll, for better or for worse, each outcome pushes the plot forward, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goal. 

### Don’t roll for insignificant things
If you can resolve the situation without a roll - do so. Don't call for a roll if the character can do something very easily (Hulk trying to lift a car), or if the character can't possibly succeed (a kitten trying to lift a car).

### Consider the situation
Take into account not just the difficulty of the task, but also the situation players are in and their approach to solving the challenge. That way the players' choices and roleplaying matter to the likelihood of the success, not just their abilities.
- Clever plan will have a lower target number than the reckless one.  
- Passionate argument with well made points is more likely to persuade an NPC than a less convincing one.  
- Injured hero will find it harder to perform physical tasks.  
- Sneaking past the guard is easier if the players have distracted them first.

### Don't roll for abilities, do roll for outcomes

Don't ask for a roll to see whether the player can use an ability - they can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun. But they may still need to roll for an outcome - whether the fireball or a grappling hook hits its aim.

The exception is when you intentionally design an ability to have a limitation that makes it unpredictable, like an ability to summon a rampaging monster that turns against the summoner if they roll below 10.

### Fail Forward
Failed rolls always lead to negative consequences and complications, raising the stakes and making the story more dramatic. 

Don’t let failed rolls to halt the story - “Nothing happens” should never be an outcome of a failed roll, players should never get stuck at the door they can’t unlock. 

If the action is required for the story to move forward, either make the success automatic, or roll for whether or not they encounter a cost or a complication:
> The door opens but you have triggered an alarm and now guards are about to show up.  

### Never roll for the same thing twice
If the players have failed a roll, they must try a different approach:
> You broke your last lockpick, you have to try something else (bribe the guard, break the door, etc.).  

> Your argument has failed to move the Barbarian and he looks angry (you can't roll for persuasion again, you have to try something else).

### Using talents requires description
If the player wants to roll with advantage - ask them to describe how they're using their talent. The goal is to prompt players to narrate and roleplay, just saying "I'm strong so I can do it" is not enough.

You can split more challenging/elaborate tasks into multiple rolls:
> Picking a lock is a single roll. To open a bank vault you might want to roll for disabling the alarm, breaking the lock, sneaking in in time to hide from the guard patrol.  
> If the players want to sway an angry Orc to their side, tell them to roll for an attempt at calming it down, then for communicating in a way that it can comperhend, and finally for convincing it to follow the course of action players want.

## Running Combat Scenes
Resolve combat the same way you resolve any other challenge in the game - with one or multiple (often 3-5) rolls. 

Don’t run combat blow-by-blow. Instead, roll to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points.

There are no hitpoints, fights are resolved narratively. Successful rolls move the players closer to victory, heroes progressively back the enemy into a corner until at some point they have an opportunity to land the final killing blow.
> Wound the dragon’s wing to force it to land, distract it to help another player to get close, avoid its attacks, pry open one of it’s scales, land the killing blow.

<Collapsible title="Example Combat">

- Players fall into the pit, a trap set up by goblins. Goblins start throwing rocks at them from above. Players describe how they dodge or hide from rocks. Roll the dice, if they fail they may have an injury or concussion we'll try to weave into the story.  
- A player comes up with a plan to get out of the pit, rolls to see if they can. If they fail, goblins manage to push them back into the pit and players have to try something else, or maybe they successfully climb out but get hurt by goblin attacks in the process.  
- Players describe how they're fighting goblins. We can do one roll per goblin, or even one roll to describe how the whole fight goes. If players fail, they're captured and carried away to the goblin camp (giving them an opportunity to do a prison break later), or just have to flee in shame.  
- If players are winning the fight, the goblins might surrender, or run away for help, forcing players to give chase (one last roll).

On failed rolls, players take damage from the enemy’s counterattack, the situation gets more dangerous, victory is harder to achieve. Describe how the player got hurt and take it into account when narrating the consequences and deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.
> The orc kicks one player onto the ground, wounds another, deflects the attack, disarms the last one. Now players have no choice but to flee or get captured.

The goal is to make combat feel like improvising a cool cinematic action sequence, as opposed to playing a turn based boardgame. You present players with interesting and high-stakes challenges, they use their creativity to invent cool solutions, roleplay the dramatic moments, vividly describe awesome actions.


## GMing Guidelines

<Collapsible title="GMing Guidelines">

<div className="columns">
<div className="col">

### Don’t over-prepare
Try to make sure you have prepared everything that would be hard to improvise on the spot, but no more.


### Yes, and
Listen to players and “yes and” their ideas. Let them take the story in their own direction, and build on top of their ideas. Play to find out what happens, don't try to force preplanned outcomes.

###  Keep the scenes short
Shorter scenes are better than longer ones. Start scenes as close to the action as possible, end them as soon as the interesting part over.

### Follow the rule of cool
The more awesome, creative, or funny the player’s idea is, the more likely it is to work.  

</div>
<div className="col">

### Ask Leading Questions
Draw players into the story and prompt them to roleplay by asking questions such as:

- How do you feel about [x]?
- What’s going through your head as you do [y]?
- Tell me, what's an unusual detail that you notice about [z]?
- How do you react when [another player] [does something]? What do you say to them?
- Do you know anything about [place or a creature the character might be familiar with]?

Ask them to describe how their actions, items, creatures, dwellings, etc. look like.

On a successful roll, prompt them narrate the whole outcome - “Describe to me how do you [defeat the enemy].”

### Prompt interactions between players
Try to create interesting interactions between players. Let one player to notice, remember, or realize something relevant to another player.
