After we have [brainstormed](/writers-room) our adventure, we can do a freeform, improv-heavy, combat-light, roleplay-focused playtest of our adventure.

<!--
Playtests are focused on storytelling and improvisation, fleshing out the details of the story, not the rules and mechanics.
-->

Our goal is to play out a fun story, see the adventure from the perspective of the players, notice any existing issues and open questions, come up with more cool ideas, and to practice running the adventure before we do it for our players.

<!--
There's no pressure to make your adventure perfect before you run it - if you're unsure of your GMing skills, or are worried that there may be some gaps in your story - this is exactly the place to practice, assume that the players will understand and help you out!
-->

### Get ready for the playtest
Our playtesting rules are short and simple. You can get familiar with them, create your character, and start playing in 20-30 minutes.

### Running the Playtest
If you want to run a playtest - go to `#playtest-announcements`, and use the following template to invite people to your game:

> **\*\*Adventure Title\*\***: <Into the Dark Wizard's Tower!>  
**\*\*Date & Time\*\***:  <Tomorrow, Jan 4th, at 4PM GMT>  
**\*\*Spots Taken\*\***: 0/3  
**\*\*Description\*\***:   
&ltDescribe the type of adventure you are looking to run, short summary of your adventure, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.>

Adventure authors can invite other people to participate in the game, or playtest the adventure between themselves (if they don't mind already knowing the spoilers). We create our characters, one person volunteers to be a GM, and we play through our adventure. 

If several authors want to try their hand at running the adventure, we can take turns GMing the scenes for each other (everyone plays as their character, one person temporarily becomes a GM and runs the game until we switch and someone else continues the story).
