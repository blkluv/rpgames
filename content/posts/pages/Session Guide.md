# Session Guide 
## Running Your Own Sessions
The Session Guide is the person who announces and runs the brainstorming session. Their goal is to guide people through the adventure creation process, keep the conversation on track, and do their best to make sure that we will be able to create a complete story within a reasonable amount of time (2-3 hours).

You're welcome to take initiative, announce, and run your own sessions.

<!-- Anyone who has participated in a few sessions and gained some experience with the process is welcome to take initiative, announce, and run their own sessions. -->

## Before The Session Begins

### 1. Make a session announcement
Go to `#session-announcements` and make a post like this:

<Collapsible title="Session announcement [Post Template]">

Hey, @everyone! Who's free to do some brainstorming at [time and date]?

We will try to make a [short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure set in a fantasy world (feel free to replace this with your own adventure type and genre)].

We will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes they go as long as 3 hours.

I'm looking for 3-4 people. If you can join us - leave a message in this chat.

If you aren't familiar with our process or haven't read the guidelines yet - please read this post before we start our session: https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room

</Collapsible>

It's best to limit the group size to 3-4 people. That way everyone has enough time to speak and contribute, things stay more manageable, and the process moves forward faster.

### 2. Create a copy of our templates
Open the [Brainstorming Template](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template) and click `File > Make a Copy`. Do the same with the [One-Page Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUqvSokoxJalKhi236xvl4q1cf7EWLVmrfgw9ljGyMI/).

Don't forget to click `Share` and change "Anyone with the link" to "Editor" (so that everyone with the link can edit the doc).

<!--
Change the folder from "Resources and Templates" to "Brainstorming Sessions Archive". 
-->

### 3. Before the session, post a reminder
10 minutes before the session begins, make a post in `#brainstorming-text`:

<Collapsible title="Session is about to begin [Post Template]">

Hey, [@-mention people who signed up] !
We begin our brainstorm in 10 minutes, get ready!

This is the google doc we’ll be filling with our ideas, please open it before we begin:
[google docs link]

Also open our adventure prompts tool:
https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts
We will use it to help us generate ideas for our adventure.

If you haven’t read our brainstorming guidelines yet - please check them out here:
https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room

</Collapsible>

If you have less than 4 people, invite more people right before the session:

<Collapsible title="Invite more people [Post Template]">

Hey, @everyone! We begin our brainstorm in 10 minutes. We have a couple of spots open, feel free to join us if you want (we can have up to 4 people).

</Collapsible>

## During the Session

### 1. Begin the session with introductions
Introduce yourself, and invite people to give brief introductions.

If you find it helpful, here's exactly what you can say:

<Collapsible title="Introductions [Script]">

Hey, everyone! Thanks a lot for joining, this is gonna be fun!

Lets start with brief introductions.

- What should we call you?
- What brings you here, why did you decide to participate?

I'll start: "I go by [Name]. I've decided to participate in these sessions because [reason, briefly]. I'm looking forward to brainstorming with you guys!"

</Collapsible>

### 2. Make sure everything is working well
Make sure that people have the Google Doc and the Adventure Prompts Tool open.

Ask them to enter their nicknames at the top of the brainstorming template.

<!--
, so you don't forget (and so they try editing the doc)
-->

### 3. Briefly recap the brainstorming process
Explain to people how our brainstorms work.

<Collapsible title="Brainstorming process recap [Script]">

Our goal is to create a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure that any of us can run for our players.

We will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes it goes as long as 3 hours, depending on how much time we have, and how much we like the idea we came up with.

We will go through the template step by step, and answer the questions to guide us through the process of creating a story.

We will fill the template with our ideas, build on top of each other's ideas, discuss and pick our favorite ones, and try to turn them into a story - an outine of the adventure that gives us all the information we need to run it for our players.

If we really like the story we have created, and have about 40 minutes of time left - we can try creating a one-page adventure out of it, which we then share with our community.

</Collapsible>

Explain your role as a session guide:

<Collapsible title="Session guide role [Script]">

My job as a session guide is to do my best to make sure that we successfully create a good adventure within a reasonable amount of time. So I will be trying to guide the brainstorming process, keep our conversation on track, and keep us going forward at a good pace.

</Collapsible>


Ask if anyone has any questions about the process before we begin.

### 4. Brainstorm the adventure idea

Go through the idea brainstorming part of the template, brainstorm ideas, and select one idea you want to develop into the adventure. 

<Collapsible title="Some tips on running the brainstorming part of the session">

- Take the lead, be the first to add an idea to demonstrate how it works. Use the adventure prompts tool to come up with an idea, add it to the list.
- Prompt the everyone else to do the same.
- Build on top of their ideas to demonstate how collaborative brainstorming works.

After you have brainstormed the ideas and created a list of Loglines - ask people which idea is their favorite. Highlight the selected idea in **bold** - that's the idea we'll be developing into the adventure.

</Collapsible>

Aim to finish this part in 40-60 minutes.

### 5. Develop the adventure idea
Go through the rest of the steps and answer the questions in the template to develop the rest of the adventure.

<Collapsible title="Some tips on running the session">

- Guide people through the process by asking them leading questions. Think about which is the most important part of the story that is still missing, and ask people to help you come up with the answer.
- If they struggle - try to come up with a few examples (even simple/bad ones will do), and ask people to select their favorite and build on top of it.
- Try to keep the conversation on track and do your best to encourage people to follow our [brainstorming guidelines](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room).
- Try to engage shy/quiet people, ask them questions like "Hey, [name], what do you think?", "What idea is your favorite?"
- Aim to complete brainstorming within 2 hours, but it's fine if it goes as long as 3. If some part of the process is taking too long - just pick the best idea you have so far, and tell people that it's time to move on (you can improve it later if you come up with something better).
- If nobody has any good ideas (that almost never happens) - go with the simple/obvious one. Simple ideas have a tendency to develop into awesome ones as you go through the brainstorming process.
- If you have 40 minutes left at the end, and really like the idea, use the One Page Adventure Template to turn the brainstormed ideas into a draft of an adventure.

</Collapsible>

<!-- - If people get stuck or can't pick an idea - call for a vote, roll the dice to pick a random one (`!r 1d10` in chat), or just make the decision yourself and move on. -->
<!-- - If nobody has any ideas - go with the simple/obvious one. Use [writing prompts tool](https://rpgadventures.io/prompts) if necessary. -->


## After The Session
- If you really like the adventure - invite people for a playtest. Learn how to run playtests [here](/playtesting).
- If you have enough time, energy, and enthusiasm for the idea - clean up the draft and turn it into a complete adventure which you can share with others. Use the `#work-in-progress` channel to discuss the adventure after the session. Once the adventure is complete, post it in `#finished-adventures`.


<!--
Make a list of things you'd like some help with - remaining open questions you're not sure how to answer, things you would like to improve, ideas to add, issues to fix. Post the link to the adventure draft and the list of questions in `#work-in-progress`, so that other people can help you out.

If everyone is cool with it, it would be nice to publish the adventure on our website and share it on reddit to grow the community.

- Dont forget to add everyone's name and discord handle to the list of the authors (at the top of the Brainstorming Template, and at the bottom of the One-Page Adventure Template).
