<Collapsible title="Completed character example (Space Adventurer)">

#### Name
Starkid

#### Description
A twelve year old space swashbuckler. Makes up for his naivete and lack of experience with relentless idealism and boundless enthusiasm for doing what's right. His parents were shot outside the opera theater by a no-good space junkie, so he was raised by a droid who taught him satudray-morning-cartoon-style morals, and now he's on a mission to make the universe a happy and fair place for everyone.

He goes on his daring adventures with his pet alien Jinx (basically Stitch from Lilo & Stitch), whom he rescued from an evil genius and taught the power of friendship.

#### Talents
Nimble, charming, crafty, brave, good at technology.

#### Abilities
- Pet alien - very agile, strong and adorable. Can chew through anything.
- Personal Droid - can do anything R2D2 can do.
- Hoverboard - floats 30 centimeters above the ground, frictionless, supports up to 100kg of weight.
- Portable Hologram Projector - creates a holographic projection of any creature or an object no larger than a car. Within 50 meters, in your line of sight.
- Boy Scout - you’re always prepared! Search through your pockets and find any mundane item of your choice (it should be believable that you have prepared in advance).

### 1. Come up with an idea for your character
Define your name, appearance, personality, motivations, backstory.   

<Collapsible title="Need help coming up with character ideas?">

If you're struggling to come up with an idea for a character - take your favorite characters from the movies, books, or games you love, and change them in some way:

- Adapt them to the genre you're playing in (take your favorite Sci Fi character, and adapt them to fantasy).
- Change one of their key personality traits (take a cool villain and create a good version of them, take a shy and humble character and play an exccentric and outgoing version of them, take a high status character and play them as low status).
- Reverse their physical characteristics (gender, age, appearance, etc).
- Combine characteristics of two different characters into one.

You can google the lists of the top TV/Movie characters, and see which ones you can change in interesting ways, which ones have interesting aspects that you like could combine to create your own character.

Examples:

- Iron Man but in a fantasy universe - a brilliant aristocrat inventing steampunk machines in his spare time.
- Low-status Gandalf - an ancient wizard shyly mumbling something about the powerful artifact that would be nice to destroy, if that's not too much of an inconvenience to you.
- Female Yoda - an old goblin witch people always come to for wisdom and advice.

Alternatively, you can start with appearance. Search websites like [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/search?sort_by=likes&category_ids=65&medium_ids=1), and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=fantasy%20character%20design&rs=typed&term_meta[]=fantasy%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=character%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=design%7Ctyped) for things like "Fantasy Character Design", or visit [/r/ImaginaryCharacters](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryCharacters/top/?sort=top&t=all). Find an image you find inspiring, and use it as a foundation of your character idea.

Finally, you can start with a cool occupation, fantasy race, or a superpower you'd like to have, and build a character around that.

If all else fails - you can always just play as a fantasy version of yourself.

### 2. Choose up to 5 talents
Talents are general areas you are really good at, they define what makes you more capable than an average person. They may include your innate strengths, background, occupation, knowledge, skills. Using talents will give you advantage on dice rolls, making you more likely to succeed at the tasks your character is really good at.

<!--
Talents are broad areas your character is really good at, they define what makes you more capable than an average person. Talents include your innate strengths, as well as expertise that comes from training and experience. 

During the game, you will roll the dice when you attempt to do something challenging. Using a talent relevant to the task at hand will give you advantage on your dice roll, making you more likely to succeed when you attempt something you are very good at (like lifting something heavy or telling a convincing lie).

Without the relevant talent, your character is as good at doing things as an average person.

<!--
Some examples you can use as inpiration for inventing your own talents:

-->

I recommend describing your character's talents using the following format:

> [**Adjective(s)**]&nbsp;[**occupation(s)**] who’s good at [**skill(s)**].

Like so:

> Tough, strong, and fearsome pirate who's good with melee weapons.

<Collapsible title="What's the difference between the abilities and talents?">

The talents make you more likely to succeed at the tasks that anyone could attempt (for example, lifting something heavy or telling a convincing lie).

Abilities give you the narrative permission to do extraordinary things a person without the ability couldn't even attempt (you can't throw a fireball unless you know the spell, you can't shoot a grappling hook unless you have a grappling hook gun).

Unlike your general talents, abilities are very specific. They give you clearly defined powers, and have clearly defined limitations.

<!-- don't give you advantage on dice rolls, instead they -->

</Collapsible>

Clearly define how your abilities work and what they enable you to do. Discuss your abilities with the GM. If an ability is too overpowered - add an interesting cost or a limitation.
