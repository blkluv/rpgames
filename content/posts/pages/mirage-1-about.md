# Mirage
Mirage is a game for people who love storytelling, improvisation, and freeform roleplay.

> Go on imaginary adventures, play out fun stories in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people.

You will love Mirage if you enjoy the social/creative aspects of roleplaying games, and want to focus on collaborative storytelling without the countless intricate rules, complex mechanics, tedious arithmetics, and painfully slow combat encounters getting in your way.

This game is also great for people who want to get started with roleplaying but have no experience, and for introducing your non-gamer friends or kids to roleplaying.
