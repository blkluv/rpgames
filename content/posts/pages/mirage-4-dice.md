## Rolling the Dice
### Beat the target number to succeed
When you attempt a task that is difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If you beat the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed, otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.

<Collapsible title="What is the target number?">

The target number represents your likelihood of success, it depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you’re in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations or risky actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?

### Use your talents to roll with advantage
<!-- 
When you have a talent relevant to the task you're attempting - you can use it to roll with advantage (roll multiple dice, and take the best result). Roll one extra die for each talent you're using, up to the maximum of 4.

You can also use your talents and abilities to help other players, giving them an extra die.

> In order to use a talent or an ability, you need to vividly describe or convincingly roleplay how you're using it to help you succeed.

You can also gain advantage by creatively using your environment or finding some clever and unusual approach to solving the challenge.

You can improve your chances by rolling with advantage - that means you roll multiple dice, and take the best result. There are 3 ways to gain advantage:

- Use one or more talents relevant to the task you're attempting.
- Use your talents, abilities, and creativity to help other players.
- Creatively use your environment to your benefit.

### Raise the stakes to reroll
Generally, when you fail a roll - you can't attempt doing the same thing again, you have to try a different approach. 

But you can still get another chance to succeed, if you describe how making another attempt puts you at risk/disadvantage, or introduces a complication that makes the story more dramatic and exciting

<Collapsible title="Examples of rolling for success at a cost">

Some possible costs:
- Cause collateral damage.
- Expose yourself to danger.
- Attract unwanted attention.
- Sacrifice something valuable.
- Break or lose your equipment.
- Give the enemy an opportunity to advance.
- Lose time.

For example:
- You fail a roll when walking a tightrope over a chasm. You can try to regain your balance, but you will need to drop your sword.
- You fail a roll when trying to pick a lock, you can try again, but another failuer will trigger the alarm.
- You fail a roll when trying to resuscitate a victim, you can try again, but it will give their attacker the time to escape.
- You fail a roll when trying to lie to another character, you can double down on your lie, but if you fail they will call the guards.
