## Taking notes
```ad-note
title: Use tags instead of full descriptions
collapse: closed

One tactic that I have seen but my tried myself is instead of writing out a monologue for your NPCs, write like tags, mental shortcuts.

For instance:

"The city of Arston is a gleaming metropolis of whitewashed stone and clean paved roads. The people look like they go around every day dressed for a festival reds, golds, and purples. The city is ruled by a mayor elected from the various parishes of the city"

Can be tagged like:

Arston, white buildings, clean, colorful attire, elected mayor.

Like I said I haven't tried it myself, but it might be worth a shot since I've heard others use the technique before.

## Descriptions

title: Focus on what makes something different.
collapse: closed

Everyone's knows what a street looks like. Talking about the cobbles or the houses on the street is boring. But the weird green slime at the sideway? That one strange green house? The fact that this particular street is always a bit slippery because there's an underground river? Or just the smell from the bakery engulfing the neighborhood in sweet delight? That's the stuff players (or readers) remember.

You don't need to describe what everyone knows, anyway, describe what they don't know.

title: Specifics, details, and metaphors to amplify immersion
collapse: closed

learning when to provide specifics to amplify immersion.

You might say it smells bad in an alleyway—but how bad? That can be a better description. “It smells like someone took a dump in this alley, puked on it, then died next to it.” See how that amplifies the idea that the alley smells bad?

---
I just want to add that another good way to give your descriptions more punch is to focus on a particular detail or two. Don't try to describe everything -- instead, pick one or two details, and really dig into those.

Do you want them to get a sense of how gruff and grizzled this old veteran warrior is? Describe the scratching sound his hand makes as he rubs it through a couple days worth of stubble, or the way his perfectly maintained sword contrasts with his dirty unkempt clothes.

I tend to focus too much on the abstract features of things, which can ultimately leave them feeling empty, even to me. I've found that picking out just one or two relevant details to describe can really make the whole thing come to life -- it gives your players some features to latch on to, but also leaves room for them to fill in the rest of the details on their own, so that you're not overwhelming them with endless descriptions.

title: Let player imagination do the work
collapse: closed

letting the player's imagination do the work for you for anything that doesn't NEED to be described in detail.

Human imagination is wonderful. If I simply say "Imagine you are standing in an ancient and eerie graveyard," your brain is probably already seeing the weather worn and tumbling gravestones overgrown with vines. You're seeing the swirling mists. 

if you're struggling with how you're going to describe a place and dreading coming up with every detail you can simply let your players brains do the heavy lifting. Give them simple moods or adjectives and their imagination will do the rest.

This also helps if there is something _specific_ that you need your players to key into, because it will tell their brains that a particular detail is important: "There is an ancient and eerie graveyard, the sun is setting and all is silent..._then in the distance you hear a bell begin to toll three times."_

What's with that bell?! Why is it ringing as the sun is going down?! WHY THREE TIMES?! WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS!!

---

be cautious with how much detail you add. More detail is not necessarily better -- for two reasons.

First, players tend to read into detail; they'll often assume that if you're going out of your way to describe something, they need to be paying attention to it (the Chekhov's gun of storytelling). If you give them too much to pay strict attention to, they'll start to lose focus.

Second, their imaginations are MUCH more powerful than your words will ever be. If you describe in painstaking detail every aspect of the place, they'll grow bored. But if you give them the framework of the place, they'll create the place.

---

its more important to describe the FEEL of the scene you are trying to set, rather than the physical characteristics.

---

give just enough detail that they can fill in the rest for themselves.

Features - Key elements in the scene. "There are shelves along the walls and a free wooden counters, all filled with low-quality merchandise."

Senses - One or two sensory features. "The room is dim, lit by only one window on the left wall, and area feels stuffy and stifling."

Events - What's going on in the area. "Two commoners are browsing the wares while the store owner watches from the back."

title: Imagine then describe
collapse: closed
close my eyes and describe the scene as if I was seeing it myself.

integrate visualization into your prep.

Sometimes it's easy to get stuck in conceptual descriptions when typing or writing, but the details that come to you when writing aren't necessarily visually vivid. When setting up a new space, character, or scene, close your eyes and focus on seeing those stimuli in front of you, then describe what you see.

As you practice this, improvising becomes easier as well, because you're not verbally improvising - you're verbally reporting what you see in your mind's eye in response to player input. This takes the stress off and matches your language to how your players will interpret information.

---

As the GM, you are the one behind the curtain, so its easy to not engage your imagination during a session. I find that my best descriptions are when I can imagine myself in the location and describe what stands out most.

---

visualize the scene or object yourself before you can expect your players to be able to do so. Imagine the object and hold it in your mind while describing it or answering questions about it. As always, you should draw details from your memories of some real or fictional thing and aim to trigger similar memories in your players.

title: Practice describing out-loud
collapse: closed
A way to practice giving descriptions is to narrate your surroundings in your real life out loud to yourself.

Talking to yourself (preferably out loud) is a great way to practice some skills that are going to help so much with improvisation. I should really start doing it for descriptions too!

Practice doing that around your house, then practice doing that for video games you've played. Describe the opening level of Bloodborne aa if you were a players eyes but not in control.

title: Incremental descriptions

Leave details out for the PCs to discover. Describe a bookcase full of old tomes, don't tell them exactly what's there.
```
```ad-note
title: show dont tell examples

if a character is supposed to be highly questionable but just a confused person, its easy to say:

"Astarorath was clearly confused and nervous, you know, cause when he hits people they usually die."

instead try:

"Astarorath recoiled at the sight of the bandit still standing. His breathing, although already hasty, increased evermore as sweat started to bead down his face."

players in combat? dont say they "miss" if they dont hit. rather that the enemy is surprisingly lucky or competent.

"You rolled a 14? You miss."

instead try:

"Drysus, you bring your longsword in a sweeping motion to rip through the Orc's chest but he quickly uses his metal gauntlets to guide the edge away."

also start to expand your dictonary, instead of slash, try strike or lacerate or sunder. it helps to draw a better picture if you add more descriptors especially for critical hits. for example:

"You slash at the enemy, critical roll damage."

instead try:

"Grampa Hendrick, guiding your blade accordingly, you make a devastating flurry of attacks with your shortsword- generating what can only be described as white streaks of absolute power. The goblin is defeated as you stand above its now limp body."

```ad-note
title: Use descriptions to draw players into the scene
Draw the players into the scene with a description, don't leave it static. For example, "Standing in front of the King's Keep are two well armoured and belligerent guards. One of them shoos an old man away, and the other turns to you and says ,'What are you looking at citizen? Move along.'"

Save long descriptions for really important locations / npcs. A long descriptions is a way saying to the players "this is important, so pay attention".

Get players to describe
Something one of my DMs did to help with descriptions is to set a very basic scene :a summer fair in the woods, for example. Then he'd go through each player and have us describe a sense. Player 1 what does it smell like? P2 What does the woods around fair grounds look like? P3 What sounds do you hear in the woods and at the fair. It really helped immerse you in the setting and was collaborative so everyone had stake (but it also didn't take away DMs power as he could add whatever details he needed like a shady character or an enticing red tent etc)

```ad-note
title: Bullet points and tags
collapse: closed

One trick I like to use during a session is have descriptor words, not full written out descriptions, in my notes. So for a cooridor location I could write "musty, echoing, cramped" that way I can remember to add those words into my description of a place.

Use bullet points in your notes covering the key details, rather than always writing out paragraphs. This will help with your delivery as it makes it easier to improvise aspects of the description and weave that into what you've already prepared. Eg, "Grand weathered stone keep, twisting spire of a wizard's tower, ominous iron gate, heavy rusted chains". Those are the main details, and you can improvise around them - much more natural feel I find!
Or, find some cool and inspiring art and use that to help you describe something.

## NPC Descriptions

When describing an enemy, there are a few key aspects of the enemy you want to capture.

-   physicality
    -   The enemy is large and strong
    -   The enemy is fast and nimble
-   mentality
    -   The enemy is calm and intelligent
    -   The enemy is furious and dimwitted
-   Defining Characteristic
    -   Distinct Armor or Weapon
    -   Uses a type of magic
    -   Has an opinion of the players and shares


How good is your mind's eye? I like to imagine that I'm interacting with the character for the first time and try to get my first impression. I want my description to be visceral.

Obviously, you'll want to describe physical appearance, but why stop there. Yes, he's a well-to-do middle-aged armorer in a leather apron with two apprentices, but why stop there? If it's the beginning of the day, he'll be energetic and clean. Maybe he smells of lye soap. At the end of the day, he'll be a little tired, maybe a little smelly. Does he have an air of satisfaction with his work or is he just logging another day because he didn't get to fulfill his dream of being an adventurer? Maybe he's resentful of adventurers living the life he thought he should have had.

Is he an understanding master to his apprentices? Are they confident in his leadership, or are they cowering and resentful?

These people have a direct impact on the spaces they occupy. When describing his workspace, how he feels about his work and apprentices will be reflected in it. If he's prideful or neurotic, every tool will be well maintained, probably have a place, and the floor will be clean. If he's a drunkard, maybe there are a lot of unfinished projects lying about.

Get a good detailed picture in your head if you can, and practice relaying what you see to your players. There's no real substitute for experience.
