If you're struggling to come up with an idea for a character - 
### Take and tweak ideas from your favorite stories
Take your favorite characters from the movies, books, or games you love, and change them in some way:
Adapt them to the genre you're playing in (take your favorite Sci Fi character, and adapt them to fantasy).
Change one of their key personality traits (take a cool villain and create a good version of them, take a shy and humble character and play an exccentric and outgoing version of them, take a high status character and play them as low status).
Reverse their physical characteristics (gender, age, appearance, etc).
Combine characteristics of two different characters into one.
You can google the lists of the top TV/Movie characters, and see which ones you can change in interesting ways, which ones have interesting aspects that you like could combine to create your own character.

> Examples:
- Iron Man but in a fantasy universe - a brilliant aristocrat inventing steampunk machines in his spare time.
- Low-status Gandalf - an ancient wizard shyly mumbling something about the powerful artifact that would be nice to destroy, if that's not too much of an inconvenience to you.
- Female Yoda - an old goblin witch people always come to for wisdom and advice.

### Start by choosing your appearance
Find an image you find inspiring, and use it as a foundation of your character idea.

To find great images - search websites like ArtStation, and Pinterest for things like "Fantasy Character Design", "Paladin", "Ranger", etc. Or view the top posts on /r/ImaginaryCharacters. 

### Start with a superpower
Finally, you can start with a cool occupation, fantasy race, or a superpower you'd like to have, and build a character around that.

### Be yourself
If all else fails - you can always just play as a fantasy version of yourself.
