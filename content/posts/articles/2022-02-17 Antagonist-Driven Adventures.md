If you want to create more dynamic adventures that interactively respond to the players' actions, you should try running antagonist-driven adventures.

In typical (plot-driven) adventures, the plot moves forward as the player characters pursue their goals, and overcome the obstacles created by the antagonist. Players are active, NPCs are passive. Players want things and try to accomplish their goals, NPCs react to their actions.

In the **antagnoist-driven adventures**, the antagonist drives the story forward as he actively pursues his goal, and it's up to the players to thwart his plans.

<!-- Benefits
Both types of adventures can be very fun, but the antagonist-driven adventures can be more flexible, because there's a villain on the opposite side of the board from the players
-->

To create such an adventure, you need to design 3 things:

## Antagonist's Motivation
The goal your villain is going to pursue at all costs.

What is their goal? Why do they pursue it? What horrible thing will happen if they succeed?

## Antagonists's Plan
When you're creating an antagonist-driven adventure, the Villain's evil plan is the plot of the adventure. Once you know what the Villain wants and the steps they're going to take to get it - you can figure out the series of challenges players must take on to stop them.

You won't have to always rely on the players to drive the story forward - they can be put on the defensive, forced to respond to villains's actions.

- What are the steps of their evil plan? How would the plot unfold if they were completely unopposed by the players?
- How will the players learn about the plan, when will the players' and the villain's goals collide for the first time?
- What could players do to disrupt and ultimately ruin the plan? How will the villain respond to these disruptions?
## Antagonist's Tools
When the players take actions, the world (the antagonist) is going to react.


- What resources do they have to accomplish their goal, fight back against players, and get their plan back on track? What "moves" will they make to make life more difficult for the players?

Unlike in written stories and computer games, in TTRPGs the antagonist is simulated using your actual human brain, so they can be truly creative and flexible. The Villain has a goal, they're going to pursue it, and intelligently respond to the players' attempts to thwart them. Players will attempt to interrupt them at every step, and the villain is going to fight back using all the powers and resources at their disposal.

Not all adventures require an active antagonist. Sometimes it's okay to just have an evil monster to defeat, a priceless artifact to heist, a dangerous environment to survive.

But I hope you can see all the ways the adventure can become deeper and more interesting when the heroes are playing against an intelligent and proactive opponent.
