If you're struggling to come up with interesting character ideas, follow these strategies and you'll have a cool idea for a fun character to roleplay as in no time.

### Take and tweak ideas from your favorite stories
Take your favorite characters from the movies, books, or games you love, and change them in some way:

- **Adapt them to the genre you're playing in**.  
For example, take your favorite sci-fi character, and adapt them to fantasy.
> Iron Man but in a fantasy universe - a brilliant aristocrat inventing steampunk machines in his spare time.
- **Change one of their key personality traits**.  
Take a cool villain and create a good version of them, take a shy and humble character and play an eccentric and outgoing version of them, take a high status character and play them as low status.
> Low-status Gandalf - an ancient wizard shyly mumbling something about the powerful artifact that would be nice to destroy, if that's not too much of an inconvenience to you.
- **Reverse their physical characteristics** - gender, age, appearance, etc.
> Female Yoda - an old goblin witch people always come to for wisdom and advice.
- **Combine characteristics of two different characters** into one.
> A squirrel from Over the Hedge with the skill set and costume of Zorro.

Google the lists of the top TV/Movie characters, pick your favorite ones, and experiment with changing them in interesting ways, or recombining the interesting aspects of these characters into something new.

### Start by choosing your appearance
Search websites like  [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/search?sort_by=likes&category_ids=65&medium_ids=1), and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=fantasy%20character%20design&rs=typed&term_meta[]=fantasy%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=character%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=design%7Ctyped) for things like "Fantasy Character Design", "Paladin", "Ranger", etc. Or view the top posts on [/r/ImaginaryCharacters](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryCharacters/top/?sort=top&t=all). 

Find an image you find inspiring, and use it as a foundation of your character idea.

### Start with a superpower
Finally, you can start with a cool occupation, fantasy race, or a superpower you'd like to have, and build a character around that.

### Be yourself
If all else fails - you can always just play as a fantasy version of yourself.
