## Notes
Having characters is how you create (or rather, co-create) a compelling story in the absence of plot.

Motivation, a Plan and a Toolkit. That is all you need to create memorable characters that move a story forward and respond to your PCs in believable ways. 
- Motivation, Goal Oriented Opponents (distinct from "Plot Oriented Opponents."). This is much more flexible.
> "When the PCs arrive in town, the mafia boss will send a 10th level assassin to the inn in the night."
vs
> "The mafia boss wants to take the Jewel of Shadows from the PCs as a gift to the princess, and he'll do anything to get it from them."
- Plan - a timeline of what they will do if the heroes don't interfere. Players will interfere, except that instead of interfering with your plot, they are interfering with your character's plan, which is way easier on you emotionally and a heck of a lot more fun for your players. And your character is going to react in order to get back onto their plan, which creates rivalry and story.
> For our mafia boss, his plan might be something like "Steal the Jewel of Shadows > Use it to Court the Princess > Marry the Princess > Kill the King and Seize Power." If the heroes foil the assassin, the mafia boss can try blackmail. Heck, he can literally offer to buy it from the heroes for an exorbitant amount of gold. Because he doesn't have a plot, he has a plan.
- Tools. Resources antagonist has to get back on track. Typical “tools” include personnel, equipment, physical locations, and information.

, and adapt the elements you have prepared into your story when the opportunity comes up.
