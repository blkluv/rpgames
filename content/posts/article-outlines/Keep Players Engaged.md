	- Put the players at the center of the story. Make the story about PCs, not about the plot.
	- Let them drive the adventure, not be driven by the plot. Make it about their characters. 
	- Player agency. Make sure players are making the decisions, not the GM. Put them into situations where they have to make choices.  let them make all the decisions. Don't have NPCs drive them through the story. Don't just tell a story the players simply tag along on.
	- Having a battle thrust upon you is boring. Having you cause the battle, or trying to reach an objective that's in the middle of the battle (and is at risk of being destroyed by the battle) is fun. Because they WANTED to go there in the first place, build the story around what the players WANT to do.
	- Balance success and failure. Don't just let them keep succeeding all the time - it's boring. Allow them to fail, make it clear that it's a setback, not a dead end. Don't let your players get to the point where they have no idea what they should be doing because everything they have tried has failed
	- Don't make the decisions for players, make it their story.

	- Player agency and engagement are reciprocal.
		Ability to make meaningful choices during the course of the game. Let players impact the story and the world.
		- High campaign level - what quest they choose.
		- How they approach solving a problem.
		- How you approach an encounter.
	- Survey. What kind of adventures/scenarios they like?
	- Interested and varied things to do.
	- End your scenes and adventures on a cliffhanger. Pause on a question. Did they succeed? A new element they ahve to consider, question posed to the player. Surprising them with something. Cut to another player, letting the player a to figure out what they wanna do. A question that needs to be answered, put on pause - add this to open loops.

	- Players mimic your energy level. Bring the energy.
	- Play styles, do what your players enjoy.
	- Keep the game moving, don't have players keep arguing about what they should be doing - stop them, put it to a vote.
