[Don’t Prep Plots](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4147/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots)
A plot is a sequence of events: A happens, then B happens, then C happens.
A situation, on the other hand, is merely a set of circumstances. The events that happen as a result of that situation will depend on the actions the PCs take.
> Situation-based design is like handing the players a map and then saying “figure out where you’re going”. Plot-based design, on the other hand, is like handing the players a map on which a specific route has been marked with invisible ink… and then requiring them to follow that invisible path.

```ad-note
title: 3-clue rule for any chokepoint problem.
> For any given problem in an adventure, you should always prep at least one solution and remain open to any potential solutions your players may devise. But for any _chokepoint problem_ (by which I mean “a problem which must be overcome in order for the adventure to continue”), try to include three possible routes to success.
```
- Apply 3-clue rule to your problems.
- Goal-oriented oppennts: Instead of trying to second-guess what your PCs will do and then trying to plan out specific reactions to each possibility, simply ask yourself, “What is the bad guy trying to do?”
- Don't plan contingencies. You don’t need a pre-programmed reaction. You’re sitting right there at the table with them. You can just react.
- Antagonist's toolkit. You can think of this as non-specific contingency planning.
[Island Design Theory](https://gnomestew.com/island-design-theory/)
As the PCs progress through the story let them find their own paths between the islands or move islands into and out of their path by modifying elements of the game being played.
- Benefits
	- Oh, and they're easier to prepare.
	- More flexible
