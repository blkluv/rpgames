## Outline
- Describe senses things other than sight.
	- Hearing
	- Smelling
	- Physical sensations (wind, temperature, touch)
- Specific cool details that paint the picture.
	the slightly noxious odor with no identifiable source; the graffiti scrawled on the wall; the bio-luminescent fungus
	- Describe 3 specific things, let the players' imagination fill in the gaps.
		- Be brief Long descriptions are boring. Few notable evocative details that let players' minds complete the picture.
	- Don't describe everything at the beginning of the scene. Describe more details in response to players taking action and shifting their attention.  When the PCs go to investigate or interact with a notable thing, that action simply triggers additional details. 
	- Let the world be dynamic and introduce new elements as the world changes (An otyugh shambles through the door. A police siren wails past the apartment building. A flickering hologram manifests in the center of the chamber.)
	- Layered descriptions.  Make sure that the players have the _key_ information they need to orient themselves and understand what’s happening;, then add details as they explore.
	- Add a specific detail. It's not just a goblin, it's a goblin with a big scar over its eye. This yeti’s fur is matted and filthy. This ogre’s hair is tied up in a topknot. This ghoul’s left arm is broken; This wraith wears an iron crown of Angorak. what’s notable.  one worg out of the pack might be limping and ostracized by the others.
	- NPCs
		- What are they doing?
		- What are their wearing?
		- Physical trait.
	- Monsters
		- Abilities/attacks, how they physically manifest
		- Non-ability based physical trait
		- Add a verb
## Notes
- 1.  If appropriate, add a verb. (Add action to the scene; e.g., instead of “there is a waterfall,” there is “a waterfall tumbles down the far wall.”) Action, something that happens, not the static scene. snow falls, leaves tumble. Dynamic scenes.

## Examples/Metaphors
- You mentioned that there was broken glass on the floor [sight], but as the PCs move into the room you can add the description of the grass crunching under their boots [sound and touch]. The waterfall was described as roaring [hearing], but you can build on that by mentioning the cool mist it throws up [touch] or the fractured reflections of light dancing across the walls of the cave [sight].
