	- Practice:
		- Voices, while sitting in your car. Make them consistent.
		- Storytelling, narration, descriptions. Pull up random pictures and practice describing them. 
	- Yes, and. or yes, but. your players. Let them have cool moments.
	- Ask "How do you do this", get them to explain it.
	- Handle shopping between sessions (unless its fun)
	- Don't control their characters, what they do, how they feel. 
	- Step up and control the games, it's your responsibility that we do things on time.
	- It's okay to be basic.
	- Take notes or record the session.
