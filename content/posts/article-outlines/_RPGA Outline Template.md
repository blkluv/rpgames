## Questions
- Who am I writing for?
- What problem am I solving? What goal am I helping them achieve?
- What question am I trying to answer?
- What are the benefits of solving the problem?
- What promise am I making to the reader?
- What emotion am I trying to generate?
- What's the next action I want my reader to take?
- Buyer's journey. Notice me, follow me, read my stuff, apply my advice and get results, know their problem and that my product is a solution to it, agitate pain, address objections, create urgency, compare to the cost of not fixing the problem, upsell
