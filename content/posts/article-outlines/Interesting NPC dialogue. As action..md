	- Determine NPCs motivations and desires. That informs what they say.
	- Don't imitate real-life accents, just change your voice pitch (etc?) and add physicality - posture, gestures, expression. Vocabulary. Tone of his voice.
	- Status - higher or lower status.
	- Disposition towards players - friendly, aggressive, suspicious. Personality - sour and pessimistic,  or optimistic? Enthusiastic or passive.
	- Practice - carry out conversation with yourself, playing two different roles.

	- Give unexpected replies.
		Most conversations are predictable, surprising responses make it memorable and engaging. jarring.
		How much does this sword cost?
		Hah, you think you can afford that?
	- Add Conflict
		2 parties attempt to reach mutually exclusive goals.
		Each party attempts to steer conversation towards its own goal.
		Player has some kind of goal (information, aid, goods and services), NPCs have their own goals (convert people to his religion, offload this cursed sword. One person wants to defeat them, another one to redeem them)
	- Interact with the environment. Describe the actions npc is taking as hes talking (sharpening the knives, unloading boxes). Set the stage.
	- Know when to summarize.  Cut out everything that's not interesting. Don't waste words/time. Summarize mundane conversations. Just describe what theyre saying instead of speaking in-character. Reserve in-character for interesting scenes.
	- Treat talking as action.
		You say things to achieve something, and the other side either resitsts, or parries, or bends to your will, either way something changes.
