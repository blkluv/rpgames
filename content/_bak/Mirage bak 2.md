# Mirage
Mirage is a game for people who love storytelling, improvisation, and freeform roleplay.

> Go on imaginary adventures, play out fun stories in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people.

You will love Mirage if you enjoy the social/creative aspects of roleplaying games, and want to focus on collaborative storytelling without the countless intricate rules, complex mechanics, tedious arithmetics, and painfully slow combat encounters getting in your way.

This game is also great for people who want to get started with roleplaying but have no experience, and for introducing your non-gamer friends or kids to roleplaying.

### 1. Come up with an idea for your character
Define your name, appearance, personality, motivations, backstory.   

<Collapsible title="Example character idea">

**Name**:  
Lorenso  
**Description**:  
Squirrel wearing a Zorro costume, riding a graceful pitch-black cat named Santiago. I go on daring adventures and elaborate covert missions, protecting the innocent, fighting for freedom, seducing ladies, searching for a way to clear my name and avenge my mentor.

</Collapsible>

### 2. Come up with your talents
Choose up to 5 talents - the general areas your character is really good at. 

Some examples you can use as inpiration for inventing your own talents:
![](/mirage/talents.png)

I recommend describing your character's talents using the following format:

> [**Trait(s)**]&nbsp;[**occupation(s)**] who’s good at [**skill(s)**].

Like so:

> Tough, strong, and fearsome pirate who's good with melee weapons.

<Collapsible title="More examples">

- Sneaky and nimble ninja who's good at climbing and hiding.
- Charming and devious thief who's good at lying and picking locks.
- Famous detective who is observant and good at reading people.
- Crafty inventor who's good at technology and creating makeshift devices.
- Wealthy explorer who's good at training animals, and surviving in nature.
- Charming grifter who's good at making connections and creating forgeries.
- Wise wizard who knows a lot of lore and is good at healing people.
- Fearless leader who's good at persuasion and diplomacy.

<!-- 
Use this list for inspiration, but don't hesitate to invent your own ideas:

<br/>
-->

</Collapsible>

Using talents will give you advantage on dice rolls, making you more likely to succeed at tasks your character is good at. Without the relevant talent your character is as good at doing things as an average person.

### 3. Come up with your abilities
Invent up to 5 abilities your character has. Abilities are your "superpowers" which enable you to do extraordinary things in the story. Abilities may include exceptional skills, magic spells, mutations, cool items, potions, pets, and even vehicles.

<Collapsible title="Example abilities">

- **Leap**  
You can jump 10 times the normal distance.
- **Telekinesis**  
Levitate small objects, no larger or heavier than a bucket of water. Works on objects within 50 meters and within line of sight.
- **Pet**  
A creature who follows your commands and can communicate with you.
- **Grappling Hook Gun**  
Shoots the grappling hook to the distance of up to 50 meters, reels it back in.
- **Cloak of Disguise**  
Creates an illusion around yourself, allowing you to assume an appearance of any humanoid creature you’ve seen. Lasts 1 hour. Can be used up to 3 times per day.
- **Hoverboard**  
Floats 30 centimeters above the ground, frictionless, supports any weight.
- **Invisibility Potion**  
Turns you invisible. The bottle has enough potion for 10 minutes of invisibility.
- **Summon Beast**  
Perform a 10-minute-long ritual to summon a rampaging animal. Roll the dice, if you roll above 10 it will obey your commands, otherwise it turns against you.  

</Collapsible>

<!--
- **Vampirism**  
I can turn into a bat, walk on walls, and regain strength by drinking the blood of my victims, but I get hurt by direct sunlight, can't walk into houses uninvited, and must feed at least once per day.  
-->

Clearly define how your abilities work and what they enable you to do, be specific. Discuss your abilities with the GM. If an ability is too overpowered - add an interesting cost or a limitation.

<Collapsible title="Example costs and limitations">

- Unpredictable - doesn't work all the time, or has a chance to backfire.
- Works only at a short distance, within a small area, within line of sight.
- Works only on specific targets - living beings, metal things, non-hostile targets.
- Expensive - requires a costly maintenance or making sacrifices.
- Attracts attention - loud, flashy, unwieldy and difficult to carry.
- Can only be used once (like a potion), or has limited ammo.
- Takes time to activate, or works for a short period of time.
- Can only be used once per scene/session/day/week/adventure.
- Has negative side effects or consequences.
- Can apply only a limited amount of energy.

</Collapsible>

After each adventure, your character can gain a new ability or improve an existing one by removing some of its limitations (discuss with the GM).

## Rolling the Dice
### Beat the target number to succeed
When you attempt a task that is difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If you beat the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed, otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.

<Collapsible title="What is the target number?">

The target number represents your likelihood of success, it depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you’re in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations or risky actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?

</Collapsible>

### Use your talents to roll with advantage
When you have a talent relevant to the task you're attempting - you can describe how you're using it to help you succeed. That allows you to roll with advantage - roll multiple dice, and take the best result. Roll one extra die for each talent you're using, up to the maximum of 4.

You can also use your talents and abilities to help other players, giving them an extra die.

<Collapsible title="Examples of rolling with advantage">

If you’re trying to really scare someone, and your character is Strong (scary looking), Insightful (can figure out someone's biggest fear), and is holding a Bloody Axe, you can add all 3 abilities to your roll and roll 4 dice with advantage.  

If you're trying to sneak into someone's office, and your character is Stealthy, has Lockpicks, and can use Telekinesis (or a trained pet) to open the window from another side, all of those will give you an advantage.

</Collapsible>

### Raise the stakes to reroll
Generally, when you fail a roll - you can't attempt doing the same thing again, you have to try a different approach. 

But you can still get another chance to succeed, if you describe how making another attempt puts you at risk/disadvantage, or introduces a complication that makes the story more dramatic and exciting

<Collapsible title="Examples of rolling for success at a cost">

Some possible costs:
- Cause collateral damage.
- Expose yourself to danger.
- Attract unwanted attention.
- Sacrifice something valuable.
- Break or lose your equipment.
- Give the enemy an opportunity to advance.
- Lose time.

For example:
- You fail a roll when walking a tightrope over a chasm. You can try to regain your balance, but you will need to drop your sword.
- You fail a roll when trying to pick a lock, you can try again, but another failuer will trigger the alarm.
- You fail a roll when trying to resuscitate a victim, you can try again, but it will give their attacker the time to escape.
- You fail a roll when trying to lie to another character, you can double down on your lie, but if you fail they will call the guards.

</Collapsible>

<!--
### Don't roll for abilities, do roll for outcomes
Normally, abilities don't interact with rolls. 
- You don't need to roll to see whether you can use an ability (you can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun).
- And unlike talents, abilities don't give you advantage on rolls

They give you a narrative permission to do the extraordinary thing they are describing.

the exception is abilities that give you advantage in certain circumstances.
or abilities that require a roll if you've designed them this way.


You don't need to roll to see whether you can use an ability - you can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun. But you may still need to roll for an outcome - whether your fireball or a grappling hook hits its aim.

The exception is when you intentionally design an ability to have a limitation that makes it unpredictable, like an ability to summon a rampaging monster that turns against you if you roll below 5.

Unlike talents, abilities don't give you advantage on rolls - they give you a narrative permission to do the extraordinary thing they are describing.
-->

### Critical Success and Critical Failure
If you roll a **20** - you succeed in an exceptionally spectacular way, the outcome is extremely favourable to you. If you roll a **1** - you fail and suffer a severe setback.

### Rolling dice on Discord
To roll the dice on our discord server, type following commands in the chat:

-   `!roll` - roll a single die.
-   `!adv2` - roll two dice with advantage.
-   `!adv3` - roll three dice with advantage.
-   `!adv4` - roll four dice with advantage.


## Roleplaying  Guidelines
Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our games. If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game.

<Collapsible title="Guidelines">

<div className="columns">
<div className="col">

### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”.

### Yes, and
Embrace other players’ ideas and build on top of them. Don’t shut down ideas. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for the other characters to shine.  

### Share the Spotlight
Avoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation. Help the quieter players to feel included - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.

### Actively contribute ideas to the story
Don’t be afraid to add information to the story. Try to describe things vividly, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the the missing information, help to create a story that makes sense. 

### Advance the Plot
Help the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.

### Be an active player
Don't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others. 

Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.

</div>
<div className="col">

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.

### Develop your Character
What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?

### Goals and Motivations
Figure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?

### Explore the Relationships
How does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?

Create interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?

### Allow yourself to feel

# Running the Game

As a GM, your goal is to create a fun story together with your players. Describe the world around the players, play the role of the NPCs, establish the challenge the heroes will face next, narrate the consequences of their actions.

To play the game you need an adventure. Find a list of premade adventures you can run for your players [here](/), or learn how to create your own [here](/writers-room).

<!-- 
Before the game, help the players to understand the rules and create their characters.

During the game, tell players what’s going on around them, ask them what they want to do, and then use your imagination, common sense, and results of dice rolls to describe consequences.

Give the players a task to accomplish (find the treasure, defeat a monster, save the princess). Put challenges on their path, obstacles to getting what they want. Watch them find creative ways to overcome them.

Imagine how the world responds to their actions, create and describe interesting consequences, add fun complications. Play the role of all NPCs like an actor, respond to what the players do the way these characters would respond.

Try to bring the story to an awesome, dramatic, satisfying conclusion. Like an epic climactic showdown with the antagonist. Watch the heroes overcome their biggest challenge and reach their goal.

## Rolling Dice (for GMs)
Before the roll, set the target number the player needs to beat in order to succeed at a task. Set lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. 5 is easy, 10 is average, 15 is challenging, 18 is very hard.

### Rare rolls, meaningful consequences
Tell the players to roll only when both succeeding and failing at an action could each contribute something interesting to the story. The situation should always change after a roll, for better or for worse, each outcome pushes the plot forward, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goal. 

### Don’t roll for insignificant things
If you can resolve the situation without a roll - do so. Don't call for a roll if the character can do something very easily (Hulk trying to lift a car), or if the character can't possibly succeed (a kitten trying to lift a car).

### Consider the situation
Take into account not just the difficulty of the task, but also the situation players are in and their approach to solving the challenge. That way the players' choices and roleplaying matter to the likelihood of the success, not just their abilities.
- Clever plan will have a lower target number than the reckless one.  
- Passionate argument with well made points is more likely to persuade an NPC than a less convincing one.  
- Injured hero will find it harder to perform physical tasks.  
- Sneaking past the guard is easier if the players have distracted them first.

### Fail Forward
Failed rolls always lead to negative consequences and complications, raising the stakes and making the story more dramatic. 

Don’t let failed rolls to halt the story - “Nothing happens” should never be an outcome of a failed roll, players should never get stuck at the door they can’t unlock. 

If the action is required for the story to move forward, either make the success automatic, or roll for whether or not they encounter a cost or a complication:
> The door opens but you have triggered an alarm and now guards are about to show up.  

### Never roll for the same thing twice
If the players have failed a roll, they must try a different approach:
> You broke your last lockpick, you have to try something else (bribe the guard, break the door, etc.).  

> Your argument has failed to move the Barbarian and he looks angry (you can't roll for persuasion again, you have to try something else).

</Collapsible>

You can split more challenging/elaborate tasks into multiple rolls:
> Picking a lock is a single roll. To open a bank vault you might want to roll for disabling the alarm, breaking the lock, sneaking in in time to hide from the guard patrol.  
> If the players want to sway an angry Orc to their side, tell them to roll for an attempt at calming it down, then for communicating in a way that it can comperhend, and finally for convincing it to follow the course of action players want.

## Running Combat Scenes
Resolve combat the same way you resolve any other challenge in the game - with one or multiple (often 3-5) rolls. 

Don’t run combat blow-by-blow. Instead, roll to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points.

There are no hitpoints, fights are resolved narratively. Successful rolls move the players closer to victory, heroes progressively back the enemy into a corner until at some point they have an opportunity to land the final killing blow.
> Wound the dragon’s wing to force it to land, distract it to help another player to get close, avoid its attacks, pry open one of it’s scales, land the killing blow.

<Collapsible title="Example Combat">

- Players fall into the pit, a trap set up by goblins. Goblins start throwing rocks at them from above. Players describe how they dodge or hide from rocks. Roll the dice, if they fail they may have an injury or concussion we'll try to weave into the story.  
- A player comes up with a plan to get out of the pit, rolls to see if they can. If they fail, goblins manage to push them back into the pit and players have to try something else, or maybe they successfully climb out but get hurt by goblin attacks in the process.  
- Players describe how they're fighting goblins. We can do one roll per goblin, or even one roll to describe how the whole fight goes. If players fail, they're captured and carried away to the goblin camp (giving them an opportunity to do a prison break later), or just have to flee in shame.  
- If players are winning the fight, the goblins might surrender, or run away for help, forcing players to give chase (one last roll).  

</Collapsible>

On failed rolls, players take damage from the enemy’s counterattack, the situation gets more dangerous, victory is harder to achieve. Describe how the player got hurt and take it into account when narrating the consequences and deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.
> The orc kicks one player onto the ground, wounds another, deflects the attack, disarms the last one. Now players have no choice but to flee or get captured.

The goal is to make combat feel like improvising a cool cinematic action sequence, as opposed to playing a turn based boardgame. You present players with interesting and high-stakes challenges, they use their creativity to invent cool solutions, roleplay the dramatic moments, vividly describe awesome actions.


## GMing Guidelines

> \- Don’t over-prepare. Try to make sure you have prepared everything that would be hard to improvise on the spot, but no more.  
\- Listen to players and “yes and” their ideas. Let them take the story in their own direction, and build on top of their ideas. Play to find out what happens, don't try to force preplanned outcomes.  
\- Keep the scenes short. Start scenes as close to the action as possible, end them as soon as the interesting part over.  
\- Draw players into the story by asking questions such as “How does your character feel about x?”, “What’s going through their head as they do y?”. On a successful roll, let them describe the consequences of their action - “Describe to me how you defeat the enemy.”  
\- Follow the rule of cool. The more awesome, creative, or funny the player’s idea is, the more likely it is to work.

# Pen and Paper Rules

Download the printable rules for offline play [here](/files/Mirage.pdf). You will also need some 20-sided dice (ideally 4 per player, but you can get by with just 4 dice for the whole group), and something to write down the character sheets on.
