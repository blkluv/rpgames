**Name**: Starkid
**Description**: 
A twelve year old space swashbuckler. Makes up for his naivete and lack of experience with relentless idealism and boundless enthusiasm for doing what's right.
His parents were shot outside the opera theater by a no-good space junkie, so he was raised by a droid who taught him satudray-morning-cartoon-style morals, and now he's on a mission to make the universe a happy and fair place for everyone.
**Abilities**: 
Nimble, charming, crafty, and brave. He goes on his daring adventures with his pet alien Jinx (basically Stitch from Lilo & Stitch), whom he rescued from an evil genius and taught the power of friendship.
