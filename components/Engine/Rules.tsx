        Story Engine is a game of improvisation and storytelling. The purpose of
        this game is to help us to practice the art of collaboratively
        improvising awesome scenes. Our goal is to roleplay through three scenes
        that add up to a fun story. Join our{' '}

        Imagine the 3 most memorable scenes from a movie - an exciting beginning
        of the story, a dramatic complication in the middle, and an awesome
        climax resolving the story at the end. Thatâ€™s what we want to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you click <Link href="#play">play</Link>, you will see a list of 3
        scenes we will play through, and your image cards below them. You and
        your friends will open that page, and take turns placing cards onto the
        empty slots (drag the image onto the slot to place it).
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick a card you think is the best suited for the next story element,
        place it onto the slot, and pitch an idea for that story element
        inspired by that image.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        For example, when you place a card onto the &quot;Setting&quot; slot,
        use its image as an inspiration for a cool setting idea, describe your
        idea, explain how it fits into the story, and what makes it awesome.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You can also place your card on top of the card placed by another player
        - in that case you will use your image as an inspiration to build on top
        of their idea and take it in a new direction.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        For example, another player has placed an image of a dragon onto the
        antagonist slot. Now you can continue the story by placing your card
        onto the next empty slot (Goal), or you can place it over the dragon
        image. If you have a card with a picture of a swamp on it, you can place
        it on top of the dragon, and say that it will be a swamp dragon.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In Your Cards section, you can click on an image to draw a new random
        card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep taking turns placing images, pitching your ideas, building on top
        of the ideas of other players, until all the slots have been filled and
        you have created a fun and exciting story.
