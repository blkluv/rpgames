      <h1>Three Scenes</h1>
      <p>
        Three Scenes is a game of improvisation and storytelling. The purpose of
        this game is to help us to practice the art of collaboratively
        improvising awesome scenes. Our goal is to roleplay through three scenes
        that add up to a fun story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the 3 most memorable scenes from a movie - an exciting beginning
        of the story, a dramatic complication in the middle, and an awesome
        climax resolving the story at the end. That&apos;s what we want to create.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Set up the scene</h2>
      <p>
        When you click <Link href="#play">play</Link>, you will see your image
        cards at the top, and, below them, a list of three scenes we will play
        through. You can click on your cards to randomize images, you can drag
        the cards onto the empty slots in the scenes, and you can hover over
        scene and slot titles to see their description.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play through the scene, we will first set up its key elements -
        Location, Characters, Goal, and Conflict. Pick a card you think is the
        best suited for the next element, place it onto the slot, and pitch an
        idea for that element inspired by that image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discuss that idea with your friends, build on top of each other&apos;s
        ideas, and then move on to the next one. Once all the scene elements
        have been established, we will roleplay through the scene.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Roleplay through the scene</h2>
      <p>
        One of the players becomes the Narrator (think Game Master), their goal
        is to describe the world around the players. The other players pick the
        characters they&apos;d like to play as. If someone doesn&apos;t have an
        established character, they will play the roles of whatever NPCs may
        come into the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each scene is about the characters actively trying to overcome obstacles on
        their path to the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the scene, we aim to progressively escalate the conflict and
        raise the stakes. The scene ends when we resolve its conflict - our
        heroes have successfully taken a step closer to achieving their goal, or
        failed and suffered some setback taking them farther away from what they
        want.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we play through the scenes, our goal is to create a fun story that
        makes sense and resolves in a satisfying way.
