The sequence of all the events is called a **Plot**.\n\nAn **Event** is a meaningful change in the character’s life, the thing that happens during the story that transforms the world from one state into another.\n\nDuring the story, the main character (**protagonist**) goes through a series of events, each of them _taking him closer to, or farther away from_ his **Goal**.\n\nThis series of events culminates in a **Climax** — the major, most important event of a story, **the moment when the protagonist achieves his goal** (or, sometimes, fails to achieve it).\n\nThe climax is what the story is about:\n\n-   Frodo drops the ring into the Mount Doom\n-   Luke destroys the Death Star\n-   Neo defeats the Agent Smith\n\nA story is divided into 3 Acts.\n\nThe **first act** is about the protagonist’s regular life being _disrupted_ by some event. This event is called **Inciting Incident** (I'll refer to it as IInc).\n\nIInc is the main reason the story has happened, the thing that kicks off a series of events that lead to climax.\n\nIInc gives the protagonist a _challenge_, creates a **Goal** — the thing the hero will be trying to achieve for the rest of the story. Often, IInc is the result of a _problem_ created by the antagonist.\n\n- Gandalf gives Frodo the Ring he will have to drop into Mount Doom.\n- Luke hears the message from Princess Leia about the blueprints he must use to destroy the Death Star.\n- Neo meets Morpheus who will tell him about the Matrix, which he will have to destroy to liberate humanity.\n\nThe first act culminates in the **First Turning Point** (TP1).\n\nTP1 is the moment when _the hero decides to go on an adventure, makes a conscious decision to engage with the story, and begins pursuing his goal_.\n\n- Frodo leaves the Shire\n- Luke's parents are killed\n- Neo takes the red pill\n\nThe **second act** is about the series of escalating events (successes and failures) which happen as the protagonist struggles to achieve his goal.\n\nThe hero pursues his goal, and _overcomes the obstacles_ set by the antagonist. From his victories and mistakes he _learns lessons_ about the world, and gains powers.\n\nAs the hero moves further, the stakes rise, his commitment to the goal increases, he has to apply more effort and take bigger and bigger risks to move forward.\n\nIn the middle of the second act, the protagonist goes through the **Mid Point** (MP) — the **point of no return**. He swims past the middle of the river, and now turning back would be more difficult than reaching the other shore.\n\nThe stakes continue to rise, until the protagonist has to **risk everything** in his biggest attempt to win. _He engages in the **final battle** against the antagonist, and puts everything on the line._\n\nThe second act culminates in the **Second Turning Point** (TP2) — the moment when the hero’s biggest attempt _fails_, when **all is lost**, the goal is no longer attainable, the antagonist seems to win, and the protagonist has been _defeated_.\n\nThe **third act** is about the final battle and its outcome.\n\nDefeated, half-dead hero _learns his biggest lesson from his worst failure._\n\nThis is usually when the biggest _twist_ happens. The hero _sees the truth_. Comes up with a brilliant creative solution, understands his mistake, realizes who was the murderer all along, finds the ultimate weapon, etc. This is what will enable him to turn his defeat into a victory.\n\n- Harry holds a basilisk fang\n- Neo sees the Matrix code\n\nArmed with this knowledge he gathers all of his strength, and takes the final effort to turn things around, to win the battle.\n\nThe hero defeats the antagonist and **finally achieves his goal**.\n\n# Story Essence\n\nWhat **is** a story? Why is it told? What lies at its core?\n\nWhen the world undergoes _change_ from one state to another, this process is called an “**Event**”.\n\nThe point of storytelling is to relay the **experience** of an event. People listen to stories to experience an exciting and meaningful event, understand it’s reasons, and learn from it.\n\n> **Story** is a description of an **Event** (change of value) and the underlying reasons for that change.\n\n### Climax\n\nA story consists of _a series of smaller events_, leading up to and culminating at **Climax** — the big and important event, the reason for telling a story. The Climax is the moment such Event happens.\n\nThe **Climax** is the key to the story.\n\nWhen you are writing a story, climax is the biggest thing you are looking for, and the most challenging thing to figure out. Once you know the climax — you have your story, because all of the key story elements are connected to it.\n\n### Protagonist\n\nWe experience the story through the eyes of the protagonist, he is our _avatar_ into the story world.\n\nThe Climax is a direct result of a deliberate action by the protagonist. The protagonist is a person who has a **goal**, and has made a **choice** to pursue it. The Climax is the moment when the protagonist achieves (or fails to achieve) his goal.\n\nAs the hero struggles to pursue his goal, he gains experience. He understands the way the world works and the reasons for that. He learns lessons, and we learn these lessons through him.\n\n### Controlling Idea\n\nControlling Idea (CI) is the _underlying reason_ for the change that happens, the underlying nature of the world we are trying to explain through our story. It is the answer to **why** the event has happened.\n\nCI is an **abstract** idea, which is being expressed through **concrete** events and actions.\n\nTo put it simply — it is a “moral”, a philosophy that is being expressed. For example, children’s fables are simple metaphors for expressing simple ideas (“lying is bad”, “be nice”, etc).\n\nCI is a “lesson” that the protagonist learns about the nature of the world that enables him to accomplish his goal.\n\nUsually, CI is expressed as a flaw that prevents the protagonist from achieving his goal, it is a “lesson” he learns during the story.\n\n### Relationships between the story elements\n\nWhen you are writing a story, the climax is the key element you are looking for. When you know the climax — you have a story, and until you know it — you don’t.\n\nAll the other elements of a story are connected to the climax, they add up to it, and are defined in relation to it. If you know the climax — you know all of the crucial elements. Here’s how elements relate to climax and to each other:\n\n![](/post/story-structure/story-structure.png)\n\n- **Climax** is a moment where the story’s main **Event** happens, that makes it the most crucial scene. Story is written about the Event, thus **Story = Event = Climax**.\n- Climax is the moment when the protagonist achieves his **Goal**. That means that if you know the climax — you know the protagonist’s goal, and vice versa. **Climax = Goal.**\n- **Inciting Incident** (IInc) is, by definition, the moment when the character acquires his goal. Usually, it is a **problem** created by the **antagonist**, a problem which the hero will struggle to solve during the whole story, and will finally solve by defeating the antagonist at the climax. That means that if **you know IInc = you know the goal**, and **you know the goal = you know the climax**.\n\nAnd when you know IInc, goal, and a climax — it is easy to figure out everything else:\n\n- At **Turning Point 1** (TP1), the hero makes a decision to pursue the goal he acquired at IInc and starts on his journey.\n- At **Mid Point**, the hero realizes he can't turn back, he has a better chance of achieving his goal than going back to the way things were before.\n- And at **TP2**, the hero seems to fail and lose his goal, it is simply the reverse of what happens at climax.\n\nNow the **antagonist** is a character whose function is to prevent the hero from achieving his goal by throwing obstacles on his way.\n\nCharacter’s **friend/sidekick** is a character whose function is to help the hero to achieve his goal (and to be a source of information — talk to the hero to provide exposition, explain to us what’s going on, render his thoughts, etc.)\n\n**Love interest** is an extra motivation for a hero to achieve his goal, a source of extra complications/conflict, and a _reward_ he gets for winning.\n\nThe hero’s **Flaw** is a mistake he makes, an internal quality that prevents him from achieving his goal, and creates **internal conflict**.\n\nThe **Controlling Idea** (the “moral” of a story) is a **lesson** the hero learns by overcoming his internal flaw, the lesson that enables him to defeat the antagonist and achieve his goal.\n\nThat way, as you can see, all elements are connected through the **goal** to the story’s **climax**. Any can be _discovered_ if you know the climax, and when you know only some of the elements but not all — you can discover climax by following these connections.\n\n# Story Writing Process\n\nNow that I’ve talked about story structure, story essence, and connection between climax and other story elements — I will talk about the story writing process.\n\n## Story elements\n![](/post/story-structure/story-elements.png)\n\nThere are 4 crucial elements you need to know about your story:\n\n- **Setting** — the world of a story.\n- **Characters** — protagonist, antagonist, others.\n- **Event** — the climax, the event the story is about.\n- **Controlling Idea** (CI) — the “moral” of a story, the abstract philosophy you want to express by giving people the concrete experience of the story.\n\nTogether they form a **High Concept** (HC) — the main story idea, original and interesting concept you can express in a few words.\n\nWhen you know what these elements are — you can find the key structural points (IInc, TP1, MP, TP2, Climax) of a story, and develop a Plot.\n\nThat will give you a pretty clear and straightforward idea of what your **3 Acts** are about. Once you know that — you can break the acts into scenes , and create **Outline**. And then use that outline(list of scenes) to simply expand it into writing.\n\n## Process\n\nYou find these elements by **asking and answering questions**. In practice any of the elements can be an initial idea/inspiration, the process is chaotic, it involves jumping back and forth between questions, tweaking, randomness, serendipity, imagination, etc. The following is an idealized, orderly version of a process.\n\n### Character in a situation\n\nIt makes sense to begin by finding an interesting **setting**, and once you know where your story takes place it is easier to find an interesting **character**.\n\nI also call it “SciFi Premise”, because SciFi/Fantasy tend to revolve around worldbuilding and unusual characters in interesting situations.\n\n### Problem\n\nOnce you know the setting and characters, your biggest goal is to find your climax.\n\nIt is difficult to come up with the climax on its own, but as I’ve said, all the elements in the story are connected, and you can unravel all of them by starting with one.\n\nIn my experience, the easiest one to begin with is **IInc**, or, in other words, a **problem**.\n\nBecause once you have your character in a setting, you can answer the question “What can go wrong?”\n\nUsually this problem is caused by the antagonist, so if you can figure out who that is it may help you to find the problem.\n\n### Goal\n\nOnce you have your problem — you'll have your IInc, you know where your story has started.\n\nAnd, you'll immediately know that the character’s goal is to solve this problem.\n\nSo even if you don’t have a very idea of your climax — you know that your character will solve this problem at climax.\n\n### TP1, MP, TP2\n\nThen you can figure out TP1 — it is simply the point when the hero decides to pursue his goal.\n\nOnce you know that, you can imagine what difficulties may arise, and how things can escalate, and as they escalate more and more — you know your MP, and as they escalate even further — you can figure out the big final attempt at achieving his goal, and how it can go horribly wrong and fail.\n\n### Climax\n\nFinally, once you know the TP2 — the lowest point for the character — you can figure out how he will turn things around and solve everything at climax.\n\n### Steps\n\nHere’s a convenient list of questions to summarize it:\n\n-   **Setting**. What is the world of my story?\n-   **Characters**. Who are the characters?\n-   **Problem** (and Goal). What can go wrong? What problem will my character need to solve?\n-   **Engage**. How does the character begin pursuing his goal?\n-   **Escalate**. How can the problem get more difficult? What obstacles will the hero face?\n-   **Lose**. What is his final, most difficult, highest-stakes challenge, and how can it fail?\n-   **Turn** How can the hero turn his defeat into a victory? How does he solve the problem?\n\n### Explore\n\nOnce you know the things you are looking for, the main steps you need to take — you search for them by asking questions, thinking, writing.\n\nUsually it is hard to write the story completely top-down (start from outline, find key points, and break things down until you have individual scenes), and it is hard to do it bottom-up (just sitting down, writing, and going wherever it takes you). So I think that the best way is to combine both options and jump back and forth. You think about the outline, you ask questions, you sit down to write, then go back to correcting the outline.\n\nIf you find yourself unable to answer some of the questions, I suggest writing a list of 5 possible options, not the best ones, just something that could barely fit, and then pick the one you like the most.\n\nAnother useful idea at this point is to just set yourself a goal to write a certain number of words (250 or 500 works well). When you are doing that, you should not think about the outline, or the story structure, or theory - just type words, this process will help you to find the answers and new ideas.\n\n## Resources\n\n<!--\nI have developed a [story template](https://nulis.io/template/Story?src=writerscoop) based on these ideas — a tool that allows you to organize all of this information, and takes you through the process of writing a story using this method.

What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?\n\n### Goals and Motivations\nFigure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?\n\n### Explore the Relationships\nHow does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?\n\nCreate interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?\n\n### Allow yourself to feel\nThis game can get really amazing when you allow yourself to really feel what your character feels in the moment. When you feel safe to express emotions around your friends, and really care about your character and theirs, you will have some amazing and unforgettable moments.\n\n### Make Friends\nGet to know people outside the games.

But for the past couple of years, I have been running [adventure brainstorming sessions](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) (a few GMs get on a voice chat and we write an adventure in a couple of hours), we have brainstormed dozens of adventures and playtested/published quite a few. I have learned a lot, and in this post, I will teach you everything I know about creating ideas that are exciting for you and for your players, in a reasonable amount of time, without ever hitting a creative block.\n\nIf you're struggling to come up with good ideas, by the end of this guide you will have more ideas than you know what to do with.\n\n# Start with a clear goal\n\nIntentional constraints dramatically simplify the creative process, so the first step is to narrow the infinite space of possible ideas down to something your brain can handle without entering the choice paralysis mode.\n\nThe more specific you can get - the better. I recommend that you at least pick a genre and a couple of adjectives describing the kind of adventure you want to create:\n\n> \n- Lighthearted comedy-heist\n- Post-apocalyptic fantasy\n- Intense spy thriller\n- Gritty western\n- Sci-fi horror\n\n# The four components of an Idea\n\n A good adventure idea is usually based on one of the following four elements, or an interesting combination of them:\n\n- **Important Objective** - an exciting problem that your players will try to solve, the goal they'll try to achieve, or an evil plan they'll try to prevent.\n- **Interesting Setting** - world and locations where the adventure takes place, with a unique twist (unusual location, nature, inhabitants, culture, etc.)\n- **Cool Characters** - a cool antagonist the players will have to defeat. With interesting goals, motivations, occupation, appearance, personality, powers, and the problems they're causing. Also, to a lesser extent, some other characters players will meet.\n- **Supernatural Element** - interesting magics, technologies, items, or creatures.\n\nYour idea can grow out of any one of these elements. Can you think of an exciting goal, setting, character, or magic you would like to build your story around?\n\nIf you aren't sure which one to start with - try making a couple of ideas in each category, and then mixing them together (the ideas should be unrelated to each other, try to make them as different from each other as possible).\n\nTake a look at some examples:\n\n> \n- **Setting + Supernatural**:  \nA lavish castle where all inhabitants have been mind-controlled by the brain slugs.\n- **Setting + Problem**:  \nA grotesque experiment has escaped from the mad scientist's laboratory.\n- **Supernatural + Problem**:  \nA love potion has leaked into the water supply.\n- **Supernatural + Goal**:  \nYou have been hired to obtain a lock of hair from the elusive Sasquatch.\n- **Character + Setting**:  \nA noble Paladin has arrived at the Pirate City to bring law and order.\n- **Character + Problem**:  \nA socially awkward prince will lose his claim to the throne unless he finds a wife by next Friday.\n- **Character + Supernatural**:  \nA pompous King has been turned into a Rat by his evil Vizier.\n\n### Bottom-Up ideas\nIf you have an idea for some very specific part of the story (you want your players to fight a certain monster, visit a certain location, find a specific magical artifact, etc.) - you can grow a story around that. Expand the idea and see if it leads you to one or few of the core components I've outlined above.\n\n>\n- I want my players to attend the King's feast:\n\t- Problem: They learn that someone has poisoned the food.\n\t- Supernatural: The cooked boar has left a ghost who is determined to ruin the feast.\n- I have a cool swamp battle-map:\n\t- Setting: The Swamplands of No Return.\n\t- Character: Swamp Witch who holds a Terrible Secret. \n- I want my players to find the Scroll of Sweet Slithering Snakes:\n\t- Character: It is being held by a brilliant, powerful, and extremely paranoid wizard.\n\t- Setting: It has been lost in the Basilisk's lair.\n\n# Blank Page vs Lego Blocks\nIt is difficult and unnecessary to try to invent everything from scratch, just by staring at the blank page and trying to make something up by thinking really hard. I struggled with this a lot, it was one of the main causes of my writer's block.\n\nInstead of staring into the emptiness of a blank page, creativity should feel like playing with lego blocks. You take existing ideas and tropes you're already familiar with, and try to recombine them in new ways, or change them and turn them into something new.\n\n### Picking Apart Stories\nYou obtain the lego blocks to play with by picking apart your favorite stories - movies, TV shows, books, games, comics, and so on.\n\nLook through the list of interesting stories, and extract the idea components out of them:\n\n- What did the main character want in this story, is there an interesting problem they were trying to solve?\n- Does the story take place in an interesting setting?\n- What are some of the coolest, most memorable characters that you've seen in this story?\n- Does the story explore some interesting magics or technologies, does it involve some supernatural creatures?\n\nNot all stories will have all the four elements, but in most of them at least one of these components is really strong:\n\n> **Objective**:  \n- Solve a murder despite memory loss (Memento)  \n- Diffuse the bomb before the bus stops moving (Speed)  \n- Defeat a skyscraper full of terrorists by yourself (Die Hard)  \n- Teach a young girl to kill so she could avenge her family (Leon)  \n\n\n> **Setting**:  \n- Hogwarts  \n- The Matrix  \n- Wasteland (Fallout)  \n- Jurassic Park  \n\n\n> **Character**:  \n- Walter White  \n- Jack Sparrow  \n- Indiana Jones  \n- Ace Ventura  \n\n\n> **Supernatural**:   \n- Time Loop (Groundhog Day)  \n- Sentient Toys (Toy Story)  \n- Body Switching (Freaky Friday)  \n- Mech Suit (Iron Man)  \n\nor a combination of these components is really interesting or unexpected:\n\n>  \n- Shared dreams + Heist = Inception  \n- Romeo and Juliet + RMS Titanic = Titanic  \n- Bank Heist + Zombies = Army of The Dead  \n- Time travel + Undo the Butterfly Effect = Back to the Future   \n- Sentient Animals + Avenge your Father = Lion King  \n- Time Travel + Robot Rebellion = Terminator  \n- Escape from Monster + Xenomorph = Alien  \n- Timid teacher + Become a Crime Lord = Breaking Bad  \n\nBuild a library of these elements. Many storytellers keep this library in their heads, but I recommend using [this google docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgasFqcKVG0f0jOwBRaHYO6dYRSkgdx-UgtXXk3ictI/) to create a digital library of ideas.\n\nStart collecting ideas. Whenever you see a movie/book/game that you enjoy, extract the ideas you liked the most, and add them to your collection.\n\nThis library is like a big box of lego blocks - when it's time to create an adventure, you can use them to assemble a new and interesting combination of ideas that you haven't seen before.\n\n> For example, let's take a few elements from the lists above and recombine them into something new:  \n> \n- **Romeo and Juliet + Bank Heist**    \nA love-struck teenager asks the players to help him commit a bank heist to impress the father of the girl he's in love with, a crime boss of a powerful mafia family.  \n- **Sentient Animals + Ace Ventura**   \nA crazy druid with the personality of Ace Ventura leads his army of sentient flying squirrels to take revenge on the lumberjack village that's destroying his forest.\n- **Robot Rebellion + Hogwarts**   \nThe animated suits of armor and the stone gargoyles have been hijacked by unknown magic and are wrecking havoc on a magic castle. The players must rescue the royal family from the castle that came alive.\n- **Titanic + Zombies**   \nA zombie outbreak on the ship leads to a catastrophe, players must survive on a sinking ship full of zombies.\n\nThe trick is to realize that there's already an endless amount of creative ideas out there, made for you by thousands of storytellers, and these ideas are already good (since they're taken from the stories you like). You can just take the good ideas out of context, and make them different and unique by changing the genre, details, and combining them with other creative ideas in new ways. Then all you have to do is to assemble all these new ideas into a story that makes sense.\n\n### Adapting Stories\nThe easiest way to come up with an adventure idea is to just adapt one of your favorite stories, changing only a few details.\n\n> **Alien in a Fantasy world**  \nStop the cruel power-hungry emperor who tries to build himself an army by breeding dangerous Xenomorph-like monsters.\n\n> **Die Hard in a Magic Castle**  \nVampires took over the magic school, you're the only ones who can rescue their hostages before they get turned into vampires.\n\n> **Honey I Shrunk The Kids**  \nEvil witch poisons the players with a shrinking potion, they must escape and travel through her (now enormous) magic hut to the top shelf where the enlargement potion is stored.\n\nThe best way to make such adventures more original is to adapt ideas from different genres and mediums. If you're writing a fantasy adventure - adapt an idea from your favorite Sci-Fi TV show (like Rick and Morty or Firefly), from a game (like Last of Us), or a musical (like Nightmare Time by Starkid).\n\n### Recombining the Elements\nCombine two interesting ideas together to create something new, mix and match the tropes, putting them together in different ways (like playing with lego blocks):\n\n> **Sentient Animals + Lord of the Rings**  \nPlayers play as mice who have stumbled upon The One Ring, and are now humanity's last hope.\n\n> **Rescue Mission + Scary Monster**  \nThe players are hired by a cooky wizard to find and return his runaway pet. His pet is a zombie chimera made out of fury and rage.\n\n> **Pirates + Floating Islands**  \nDefend a floating pirate town (think Tortuga) being attacked by a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”.\n\nNotice that the individual ideas don't have to be that interesting or original - you can just lift them from other stories, which is very easy to do. The unique combination of two simple ideas is what makes your story creative, unique, and original.\n\n### Changing the Elements\nAnother way to build on top of the ideas and make them more original is to change them in interesting ways.\n\nTo change an idea, you need to take one of its key elements and reverse it (do the opposite), exaggerate it (take it to the extreme), or replace it with an entirely different element (idea from a completely different story or genre).\n\n> **Reverse the Goal: Rescue the Dragon from the Princess**  \nA cruel princess has kidnapped the baby dragon's mom, and is forcing her to fight in a coliseum. Help to rescue the big mama dragon.\n\n> **Reverse the Key Character Trait: Evil Batman**  \nProtect the city from a ruthless high-tech vigilante driven by his misguided code of honor.\n\n> **Change the Setting: Typical Train Heist story, set on a Zeppelin**  \nRescue an innocent person being delivered by Zeppelin to serve her life sentence in prison.\n\n> **Exaggerate the Supernatural Element**  \nSolve the disappearance of cows in a village where **everyone** is secretly a werewolf.\n\n## Combining Your Own Ideas\nMake a list of 5-10 ideas using the methods above, and then combine/reverse/exaggerate some of *these* ideas to make something even more unique and interesting.\n\n>\n- **Zombies on the Titanic + Ace Ventura**  \nThe zombies have been released by a crazy zombie-rights activist who has steered the ship into the island where he's planning to build his own zombie utopia.\n- **Runaway Chimera + Pirates of the Floating Island**  \nPlayers must protect the escaped gargoyle (a protected species) from the crew of flying pirates who are determined to capture it.\n- **Shrinking Potion + The King's Feast**  \nKing's enemies have added the shrinking potion into wine, and now players must help the king to fight off the rebellion despite being the size of an ant.\n\n## Using Images and Adventure Prompts\nJust like extracting ideas from books and movies, you can extract them from artworks, which are a goldmine of useful ideas. [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/) has a lot of beautiful artworks, and the functionality that allows you to categorize them and build collections. You can install the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artstation-discover/ghkbedmkakkdhfkhchadmkhlflnafocm?hl=en) that randomly shows you a new artwork every time you open a new tab in the browser. Add the most inspiring images to your collection, and then use them as prompts to come up with ideas.\n\nI have already built a pretty big collection of cool ideas, and created a tool that recombines them for you automatically. Try using the [Adventure Prompts Tool](https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts) - generate random prompts and try to pitch a few ideas based on the combinations of these elements.\n\nI recommend setting a 2-minute timer, and challenging yourself to pitch a story idea based on whatever random prompts you end up with. These pitches often end up surprisingly interesting and creative, and in 20 minutes you can create 10 such pitches you can add to your list of ideas.\n\nIt is much easier and more fun to do this together with a friend - take turns generating prompts and pitching ideas, then build on top of each other's ideas using the methods described above.\n\n## More Good Sources of Story Ideas\nAside from passively collecting ideas from the movies you're watching and the books you're reading, you can actively research ideas. Browse the lists of stories until you find an element that gets you excited, and build an adventure around it.\n\n- [IMDB list of top movies and TV Shows](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature,tv_series&user_rating=6.0,10.0&sort=num_votes,desc&count=250).   \nUse [advanced search](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/) to narrow them down by genre, rating, etc.\n- Lists of TV episodes on Wikipedia:   \n[Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29#Episodes)  \n[Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Disenchantment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment_%28TV_series%29#Episodes)  \n[X-Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Scooby Doo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scooby-Doo!_Mystery_Incorporated_episodes)  \n- [TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighConcept)\n- [Adventure Lookup](https://adventurelookup.com/adventures)\n- [/r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/)\n- [Big list of RPG plots](https://kimberleycresswell.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the-big-list-of-rpg-plots.pdf)\n- [Follow RPG](http://www.lamemage.com/follow/).\n\n# Primary Objective\nYour adventure idea isn't complete until you have figured out the Primary Objective your players will try to pursue - a **Problem** they will be trying to solve or a **Goal** they will be trying to accomplish.\n\nThe Primary Objective is the **core of your story**, the most important element you need to figure out. Once you know the Objective - everything else will fall into place, because almost all the other elements of the adventure are defined in relation to the Objective:\n\n- **Adventure Hook** is the moment at the beginning of the adventure where the players encounter the Problem they must solve or establish the Goal they will try to achieve.\n- **Antagonist** is the primary force that stands in the way of the players, their goal is the opposite of the heroes' Objective.\n- **Challenges and Encounters** are the obstacles that the players will need to overcome on their path to the Objective.\n- **Intriguing Mysteries** are bits and pieces of information the players will gather throughout their adventure that are required for them to accomplish their goal.\n- **Surprising Twist** is the moment in the middle of the adventure when the players' Objective changes in some way - they realize that it's not what they once thought it was, or some complication makes it much more difficult to achieve.\n- **The Climax** of the adventure is the moment when the Objective is resolved, when the players succeed at accomplishing their goal (or, rarely, fail to do so and lose).\n\nResolving the Objective will be the single most important event in the story, it will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the \"final battle\" revolves around.\n\n## Stories are about Problem Solving\nStories and roleplaying games are fundamentally about creative problem-solving. \n\nAdventure Ideas are fundamentally problems. They create an exciting, challenging, important goal for the players to accomplish.\n\nThis is the fundamental \"game loop\" of an RPG - the GM puts an interesting problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it.\n\nBig problems are broken down into smaller Challenges. In every scene the characters try to solve a small problem, their successes take them closer to achieving their goal, the setbacks and complications take them farther away from that goal.\n\nPlayers encounter a big problem at the beginning of the story, they go through a series of challenges that add up to ultimately solving the problem at the Climax of the story. \n\nThis gives the players a sense of progress, makes them feel like their actions are meaningful, make an impact on the world, add up to some larger purpose. The Primary Objective is that purpose.\n\n## What makes a Good Primary Objective\nThe Primary Objective is a **specific thing the players must do** in order to succeed in their quest. A specific action they must take that will resolve the main conflict.\n\nPrimary Objective must be:  \n\n- **High Stakes** - players should care about accomplishing it. It should be very meaningful and important to the characters and to the world they live in. Players should have a good reason to pursue it, whatever it takes.\n- **Exciting** - the problem should be interesting to solve, the goal should be desirable to achieve. Players will spend the whole adventure doing everything in their power to accomplish this, so it should be something fun to participate in.\n- **Difficult** - the objective should be difficult to accomplish. It will be the main source of challenges and conflict in your story, it will create a lot of struggle for the characters, and you want your players to feel epic and heroic when they succeed.\n\n> **Objective Examples**:  \n- Kill the dragon to save the village.  \n- Break out an innocent from an unassailable prison.  \n- Stop the Villain from opening a portal into the Demon Dimension.  \n- Solve the crime to prevent a war between the two kingdoms.  \n\n## Objectives and Villains\nObjectives come in two types, like two sides of the same coin:\n\n> **Players really want something, and the villain stands in their way.**  \n- Rescue a princess from a dragon.  \n- Journey to a distant location and find treasure.  \n- Broker peace between warring kingdoms.  \n- Perform the heist of the century.  \n\n> **Villain really wants something, and players must do whatever it takes to stop them.**  \n- Prevent the villain from performing a terrible world-ending ritual.  \n- Make sure the villain won't get their hands on a powerful artifact.  \n- The Villain wants to kill or kidnap someone, and the players must protect them.  \n- The Villain is pursuing the players, and they must escape to survive.  \n\nSo any idea you have for an Objective is actually two ideas - it is either something the players want to pursue (\"Kill a Terrible Monster\"), or must prevent the villain from obtaining (\"Protect an Adorable Creature from the evil Hunter.\"). \n\nLooking at the Objectives this way doubles the amount of ideas you have, and helps you to come up with interesting and unusual stories (by swapping the Heroes and the Villains, telling the story from the perspective of the Antagonist).\n\n## Objective Archetypes\nJust as described above, taking ideas from your favorite stories (and changing them a bit) is one of the best ways to come up with your objective.\n\nUnlike the other story elements, the objectives actually tend to be pretty generic - there's a limited amount of story archetypes (the goals the heroes can pursue). There are about 10-20 most common objectives that 90% of the stories revolve around. What makes an objective unique is the specifics of the story, all the other elements of the adventure idea that surround the objective.\n\nWhen you watch movies and read stories, learn to notice the objective the heroes are trying to pursue, and compile a list of your favorite ones.\n\n> Here are some of the most common objectives:\n> \n- Obtaining some important item (McGuffin), creature, person, or information.  \n(Train robberies, fetch quests, rescue missions, spy missions, capturing fugitives.)\n- Killing/defeating a Villain or a dangerous monster who's up to no good.  \n(Horror movies, superhero movies, many sci-fi and fantasy movies.)\n- Traveling to some distant location through dangerous territory, or ending up in a dangerous place and trying to survive and return home.  \n(Most adventure stories).\n- Solving mysteries, finding out the truth.  \n(Most detective and mystery stories).\n- Invading, Defending, or Escaping a location.  \n(Heists, prison breaks, many action movies).\n- Convincing/manipulating people, gaining power through non-violent means.   \n(Intrigue, drama).\n\n(or preventing a villain from doing one of the above).\n\n[Here](https://rpgadventures.io/files/objective-archetypes.pdf) you can see the full list of the objectives I have compiled. You can go through the list and try applying each of the ideas to your premise, that is a sure way to generate a lot of new and interesting story ideas.\n\n## Premise-Based Objectives\nVery often the objective will grow naturally out of the story idea you have developed.\n\n- **Start with a Villain** - come up with an idea for a villain, and figure out what it is that they want that the heroes must try to prevent.\n- **Start with the Setting** - what's wrong with the world the heroes are living in, what must be fixed?\n- **Start with the Supernatural Element** - some kind of magic, spell, technology, or a creature is causing problems, and the story is about resolving those problems.\n\nMost of the time when you have any idea, it's possible to figure out what kind of Objective it naturally leads to. Is that something heroes want? Is that something they fear? Is it causing some problems they must solve?\n\n> Examples:  \n- Villain - Crazy scientist obsessed with world domination.    \nObjective - stop him from performing his dangerous experiment.  \n- Setting - a dystopian world where the good has won, and is now ruthlessly oppressing the evil.    \nObjective - incite the monster rebellion and lead it against the Paladin army.  \n- Supernatural Element - a magic Trident used to control the Kraken.    \nObjective - steal it from the Pirate Lord who's currently using it to control the seas.  \n\n## Difficulties\nOne of the best ways to make the Objective more interesting is to add some restriction to it that makes it more difficult:\n\n>\n- Problem must be solved using social/political means only.\n- Problem must be solved stealthily, secretly, undercover.\n- Problem must be solved under time pressure.\n- Players must avoid violence, collateral damage.\n- Players must compete with the rivals.\n- Players must cooperate with the enemy.\n- Players have incomplete/false information.\n- Players have limited resources/preparation.\n- Players must do it while protecting someone.\n- Players must do it under scrutiny/supervision, bound by strict rules/laws.\n- Target must be unharmed.\n\n## Developing your Ideas\nNow you have countless ways of finding adventure ideas, and strategies to create infinite combinations of them. You know how to come up with an exciting premise for your story, and an objective for your players to accomplish, which makes the process of creating the rest of the adventure very straightforward and easy.\n\nThe next step is to make a list of 5-10 ideas, pick your favorite one, and develop it into a story. To do that, you can use the [brainstorming template](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template) - it will guide you through the process of turning your idea into a story.\n\nI also wrote an adventure writing course, which is available for free [here](https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy). In this course I share everything I know about creating adventures, and guide you through a straightforward step-by-step process to creating your own one-shot adventure. If you've enjoyed this post - you will really love the course.\n\nI hope you found this guide useful. If you have any questions, feedback on how I can make it better, or your own tips on creating adventure ideas - please leave them in the comments.","html":"<p>This is my in-depth step-by-step guide to coming up with endless amount of exciting adventure ideas that you and your players can't wait to play with.</p>\n<p>Coming up with ideas used to be extremely difficult for me, as I'm not a naturally creative person. But for the past couple of years, I have been running <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room\">adventure brainstorming sessions</a> (a few GMs get on a voice chat and we write an adventure in a couple of hours), we have brainstormed dozens of adventures and playtested/published quite a few. I have learned a lot, and in this post, I will teach you everything I know about creating ideas that are exciting for you and for your players, in a reasonable amount of time, without ever hitting a creative block.</p>\n<p>If you're struggling to come up with good ideas, by the end of this guide you will have more ideas than you know what to do with.</p>\n<h1 id=\"start-with-a-clear-goal\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#start-with-a-clear-goal\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Start with a clear goal</h1>\n<p>Intentional constraints dramatically simplify the creative process, so the first step is to narrow the infinite space of possible ideas down to something your brain can handle without entering the choice paralysis mode.</p>\n<p>The more specific you can get - the better. I recommend that you at least pick a genre and a couple of adjectives describing the kind of adventure you want to create:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Lighthearted comedy-heist</li>\n<li>Post-apocalyptic fantasy</li>\n<li>Intense spy thriller</li>\n<li>Gritty western</li>\n<li>Sci-fi horror</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-four-components-of-an-idea\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#the-four-components-of-an-idea\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The four components of an Idea</h1>\n<p>A good adventure idea is usually based on one of the following four elements, or an interesting combination of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Important Objective</strong> - an exciting problem that your players will try to solve, the goal they'll try to achieve, or an evil plan they'll try to prevent.</li>\n<li><strong>Interesting Setting</strong> - world and locations where the adventure takes place, with a unique twist (unusual location, nature, inhabitants, culture, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Cool Characters</strong> - a cool antagonist the players will have to defeat. With interesting goals, motivations, occupation, appearance, personality, powers, and the problems they're causing. Also, to a lesser extent, some other characters players will meet.</li>\n<li><strong>Supernatural Element</strong> - interesting magics, technologies, items, or creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your idea can grow out of any one of these elements. Can you think of an exciting goal, setting, character, or magic you would like to build your story around?</p>\n<p>If you aren't sure which one to start with - try making a couple of ideas in each category, and then mixing them together (the ideas should be unrelated to each other, try to make them as different from each other as possible).</p>\n<p>Take a look at some examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Setting + Supernatural</strong>:<br>\nA lavish castle where all inhabitants have been mind-controlled by the brain slugs.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting + Problem</strong>:<br>\nA grotesque experiment has escaped from the mad scientist's laboratory.</li>\n<li><strong>Supernatural + Problem</strong>:<br>\nA love potion has leaked into the water supply.</li>\n<li><strong>Supernatural + Goal</strong>:<br>\nYou have been hired to obtain a lock of hair from the elusive Sasquatch.</li>\n<li><strong>Character + Setting</strong>:<br>\nA noble Paladin has arrived at the Pirate City to bring law and order.</li>\n<li><strong>Character + Problem</strong>:<br>\nA socially awkward prince will lose his claim to the throne unless he finds a wife by next Friday.</li>\n<li><strong>Character + Supernatural</strong>:<br>\nA pompous King has been turned into a Rat by his evil Vizier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bottom-up-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#bottom-up-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bottom-Up ideas</h3>\n<p>If you have an idea for some very specific part of the story (you want your players to fight a certain monster, visit a certain location, find a specific magical artifact, etc.) - you can grow a story around that. Expand the idea and see if it leads you to one or few of the core components I've outlined above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I want my players to attend the King's feast:\n<ul>\n<li>Problem: They learn that someone has poisoned the food.</li>\n<li>Supernatural: The cooked boar has left a ghost who is determined to ruin the feast.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I have a cool swamp battle-map:\n<ul>\n<li>Setting: The Swamplands of No Return.</li>\n<li>Character: Swamp Witch who holds a Terrible Secret.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I want my players to find the Scroll of Sweet Slithering Snakes:\n<ul>\n<li>Character: It is being held by a brilliant, powerful, and extremely paranoid wizard.</li>\n<li>Setting: It has been lost in the Basilisk's lair.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"blank-page-vs-lego-blocks\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#blank-page-vs-lego-blocks\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Blank Page vs Lego Blocks</h1>\n<p>It is difficult and unnecessary to try to invent everything from scratch, just by staring at the blank page and trying to make something up by thinking really hard. I struggled with this a lot, it was one of the main causes of my writer's block.</p>\n<p>Instead of staring into the emptiness of a blank page, creativity should feel like playing with lego blocks. You take existing ideas and tropes you're already familiar with, and try to recombine them in new ways, or change them and turn them into something new.</p>\n<h3 id=\"picking-apart-stories\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#picking-apart-stories\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Picking Apart Stories</h3>\n<p>You obtain the lego blocks to play with by picking apart your favorite stories - movies, TV shows, books, games, comics, and so on.</p>\n<p>Look through the list of interesting stories, and extract the idea components out of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What did the main character want in this story, is there an interesting problem they were trying to solve?</li>\n<li>Does the story take place in an interesting setting?</li>\n<li>What are some of the coolest, most memorable characters that you've seen in this story?</li>\n<li>Does the story explore some interesting magics or technologies, does it involve some supernatural creatures?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not all stories will have all the four elements, but in most of them at least one of these components is really strong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve a murder despite memory loss (Memento)</li>\n<li>Diffuse the bomb before the bus stops moving (Speed)</li>\n<li>Defeat a skyscraper full of terrorists by yourself (Die Hard)</li>\n<li>Teach a young girl to kill so she could avenge her family (Leon)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Hogwarts</li>\n<li>The Matrix</li>\n<li>Wasteland (Fallout)</li>\n<li>Jurassic Park</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Character</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Walter White</li>\n<li>Jack Sparrow</li>\n<li>Indiana Jones</li>\n<li>Ace Ventura</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Supernatural</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Time Loop (Groundhog Day)</li>\n<li>Sentient Toys (Toy Story)</li>\n<li>Body Switching (Freaky Friday)</li>\n<li>Mech Suit (Iron Man)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or a combination of these components is really interesting or unexpected:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared dreams + Heist = Inception</li>\n<li>Romeo and Juliet + RMS Titanic = Titanic</li>\n<li>Bank Heist + Zombies = Army of The Dead</li>\n<li>Time travel + Undo the Butterfly Effect = Back to the Future</li>\n<li>Sentient Animals + Avenge your Father = Lion King</li>\n<li>Time Travel + Robot Rebellion = Terminator</li>\n<li>Escape from Monster + Xenomorph = Alien</li>\n<li>Timid teacher + Become a Crime Lord = Breaking Bad</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Build a library of these elements. Many storytellers keep this library in their heads, but I recommend using <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgasFqcKVG0f0jOwBRaHYO6dYRSkgdx-UgtXXk3ictI/\">this google docs template</a> to create a digital library of ideas.</p>\n<p>Start collecting ideas. Whenever you see a movie/book/game that you enjoy, extract the ideas you liked the most, and add them to your collection.</p>\n<p>This library is like a big box of lego blocks - when it's time to create an adventure, you can use them to assemble a new and interesting combination of ideas that you haven't seen before.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, let's take a few elements from the lists above and recombine them into something new:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Romeo and Juliet + Bank Heist</strong><br>\nA love-struck teenager asks the players to help him commit a bank heist to impress the father of the girl he's in love with, a crime boss of a powerful mafia family.</li>\n<li><strong>Sentient Animals + Ace Ventura</strong><br>\nA crazy druid with the personality of Ace Ventura leads his army of sentient flying squirrels to take revenge on the lumberjack village that's destroying his forest.</li>\n<li><strong>Robot Rebellion + Hogwarts</strong><br>\nThe animated suits of armor and the stone gargoyles have been hijacked by unknown magic and are wrecking havoc on a magic castle. The players must rescue the royal family from the castle that came alive.</li>\n<li><strong>Titanic + Zombies</strong><br>\nA zombie outbreak on the ship leads to a catastrophe, players must survive on a sinking ship full of zombies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The trick is to realize that there's already an endless amount of creative ideas out there, made for you by thousands of storytellers, and these ideas are already good (since they're taken from the stories you like). You can just take the good ideas out of context, and make them different and unique by changing the genre, details, and combining them with other creative ideas in new ways. Then all you have to do is to assemble all these new ideas into a story that makes sense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adapting-stories\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#adapting-stories\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Adapting Stories</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to come up with an adventure idea is to just adapt one of your favorite stories, changing only a few details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alien in a Fantasy world</strong><br>\nStop the cruel power-hungry emperor who tries to build himself an army by breeding dangerous Xenomorph-like monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Die Hard in a Magic Castle</strong><br>\nVampires took over the magic school, you're the only ones who can rescue their hostages before they get turned into vampires.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Honey I Shrunk The Kids</strong><br>\nEvil witch poisons the players with a shrinking potion, they must escape and travel through her (now enormous) magic hut to the top shelf where the enlargement potion is stored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best way to make such adventures more original is to adapt ideas from different genres and mediums. If you're writing a fantasy adventure - adapt an idea from your favorite Sci-Fi TV show (like Rick and Morty or Firefly), from a game (like Last of Us), or a musical (like Nightmare Time by Starkid).</p>\n<h3 id=\"recombining-the-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#recombining-the-elements\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Recombining the Elements</h3>\n<p>Combine two interesting ideas together to create something new, mix and match the tropes, putting them together in different ways (like playing with lego blocks):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sentient Animals + Lord of the Rings</strong><br>\nPlayers play as mice who have stumbled upon The One Ring, and are now humanity's last hope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rescue Mission + Scary Monster</strong><br>\nThe players are hired by a cooky wizard to find and return his runaway pet. His pet is a zombie chimera made out of fury and rage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pirates + Floating Islands</strong><br>\nDefend a floating pirate town (think Tortuga) being attacked by a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice that the individual ideas don't have to be that interesting or original - you can just lift them from other stories, which is very easy to do. The unique combination of two simple ideas is what makes your story creative, unique, and original.</p>\n<h3 id=\"changing-the-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#changing-the-elements\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Changing the Elements</h3>\n<p>Another way to build on top of the ideas and make them more original is to change them in interesting ways.</p>\n<p>To change an idea, you need to take one of its key elements and reverse it (do the opposite), exaggerate it (take it to the extreme), or replace it with an entirely different element (idea from a completely different story or genre).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reverse the Goal: Rescue the Dragon from the Princess</strong><br>\nA cruel princess has kidnapped the baby dragon's mom, and is forcing her to fight in a coliseum. Help to rescue the big mama dragon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reverse the Key Character Trait: Evil Batman</strong><br>\nProtect the city from a ruthless high-tech vigilante driven by his misguided code of honor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Change the Setting: Typical Train Heist story, set on a Zeppelin</strong><br>\nRescue an innocent person being delivered by Zeppelin to serve her life sentence in prison.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exaggerate the Supernatural Element</strong><br>\nSolve the disappearance of cows in a village where <strong>everyone</strong> is secretly a werewolf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"combining-your-own-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#combining-your-own-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Combining Your Own Ideas</h2>\n<p>Make a list of 5-10 ideas using the methods above, and then combine/reverse/exaggerate some of <em>these</em> ideas to make something even more unique and interesting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zombies on the Titanic + Ace Ventura</strong><br>\nThe zombies have been released by a crazy zombie-rights activist who has steered the ship into the island where he's planning to build his own zombie utopia.</li>\n<li><strong>Runaway Chimera + Pirates of the Floating Island</strong><br>\nPlayers must protect the escaped gargoyle (a protected species) from the crew of flying pirates who are determined to capture it.</li>\n<li><strong>Shrinking Potion + The King's Feast</strong><br>\nKing's enemies have added the shrinking potion into wine, and now players must help the king to fight off the rebellion despite being the size of an ant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"using-images-and-adventure-prompts\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#using-images-and-adventure-prompts\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Using Images and Adventure Prompts</h2>\n<p>Just like extracting ideas from books and movies, you can extract them from artworks, which are a goldmine of useful ideas. <a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/\">ArtStation</a> has a lot of beautiful artworks, and the functionality that allows you to categorize them and build collections. You can install the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artstation-discover/ghkbedmkakkdhfkhchadmkhlflnafocm?hl=en\">extension</a> that randomly shows you a new artwork every time you open a new tab in the browser. Add the most inspiring images to your collection, and then use them as prompts to come up with ideas.</p>\n<p>I have already built a pretty big collection of cool ideas, and created a tool that recombines them for you automatically. Try using the <a href=\"https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts\">Adventure Prompts Tool</a> - generate random prompts and try to pitch a few ideas based on the combinations of these elements.</p>\n<p>I recommend setting a 2-minute timer, and challenging yourself to pitch a story idea based on whatever random prompts you end up with. These pitches often end up surprisingly interesting and creative, and in 20 minutes you can create 10 such pitches you can add to your list of ideas.</p>\n<p>It is much easier and more fun to do this together with a friend - take turns generating prompts and pitching ideas, then build on top of each other's ideas using the methods described above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-good-sources-of-story-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#more-good-sources-of-story-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>More Good Sources of Story Ideas</h2>\n<p>Aside from passively collecting ideas from the movies you're watching and the books you're reading, you can actively research ideas.

Once you know the Objective - everything else will fall into place, because almost all the other elements of the adventure are defined in relation to the Objective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adventure Hook</strong> is the moment at the beginning of the adventure where the players encounter the Problem they must solve or establish the Goal they will try to achieve.</li>\n<li><strong>Antagonist</strong> is the primary force that stands in the way of the players, their goal is the opposite of the heroes' Objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges and Encounters</strong> are the obstacles that the players will need to overcome on their path to the Objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Intriguing Mysteries</strong> are bits and pieces of information the players will gather throughout their adventure that are required for them to accomplish their goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Surprising Twist</strong> is the moment in the middle of the adventure when the players' Objective changes in some way - they realize that it's not what they once thought it was, or some complication makes it much more difficult to achieve.</li>\n<li><strong>The Climax</strong> of the adventure is the moment when the Objective is resolved, when the players succeed at accomplishing their goal (or, rarely, fail to do so and lose).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Resolving the Objective will be the single most important event in the story, it will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the \"final battle\" revolves around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stories-are-about-problem-solving\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#stories-are-about-problem-solving\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Stories are about Problem Solving</h2>\n<p>Stories and roleplaying games are fundamentally about creative problem-solving.</p>\n<p>Adventure Ideas are fundamentally problems. They create an exciting, challenging, important goal for the players to accomplish.</p>\n<p>This is the fundamental \"game loop\" of an RPG - the GM puts an interesting problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it.</p>\n<p>Big problems are broken down into smaller Challenges. In every scene the characters try to solve a small problem, their successes take them closer to achieving their goal, the setbacks and complications take them farther away from that goal.</p>\n<p>Players encounter a big problem at the beginning of the story, they go through a series of challenges that add up to ultimately solving the problem at the Climax of the story.</p>\n<p>This gives the players a sense of progress, makes them feel like their actions are meaningful, make an impact on the world, add up to some larger purpose. The Primary Objective is that purpose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-a-good-primary-objective\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#what-makes-a-good-primary-objective\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What makes a Good Primary Objective</h2>\n<p>The Primary Objective is a <strong>specific thing the players must do</strong> in order to succeed in their quest. A specific action they must take that will resolve the main conflict.</p>\n<p>Primary Objective must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Stakes</strong> - players should care about accomplishing it. It should be very meaningful and important to the characters and to the world they live in. Players should have a good reason to pursue it, whatever it takes.</li>\n<li><strong>Exciting</strong> - the problem should be interesting to solve, the goal should be desirable to achieve. Players will spend the whole adventure doing everything in their power to accomplish this, so it should be something fun to participate in.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult</strong> - the objective should be difficult to accomplish. It will be the main source of challenges and conflict in your story, it will create a lot of struggle for the characters, and you want your players to feel epic and heroic when they succeed.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Objective Examples</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Kill the dragon to save the village.</li>\n<li>Break out an innocent from an unassailable prison.</li>\n<li>Stop the Villain from opening a portal into the Demon Dimension.</li>\n<li>Solve the crime to prevent a war between the two kingdoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"objectives-and-villains\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#objectives-and-villains\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Objectives and Villains</h2>\n<p>Objectives come in two types, like two sides of the same coin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Players really want something, and the villain stands in their way.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Rescue a princess from a dragon.</li>\n<li>Journey to a distant location and find treasure.</li>\n<li>Broker peace between warring kingdoms.</li>\n<li>Perform the heist of the century.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Villain really wants something, and players must do whatever it takes to stop them.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent the villain from performing a terrible world-ending ritual.</li>\n<li>Make sure the villain won't get their hands on a powerful artifact.</li>\n<li>The Villain wants to kill or kidnap someone, and the players must protect them.</li>\n<li>The Villain is pursuing the players, and they must escape to survive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So any idea you have for an Objective is actually two ideas - it is either something the players want to pursue (\"Kill a Terrible Monster\"), or must prevent the villain from obtaining (\"Protect an Adorable Creature from the evil Hunter.\").</p>\n<p>Looking at the Objectives this way doubles the amount of ideas you have, and helps you to come up with interesting and unusual stories (by swapping the Heroes and the Villains, telling the story from the perspective of the Antagonist).</p>\n<h2 id=\"objective-archetypes\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#objective-archetypes\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Objective Archetypes</h2>\n<p>Just as described above, taking ideas from your favorite stories (and changing them a bit) is one of the best ways to come up with your objective.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other story elements, the objectives actually tend to be pretty generic - there's a limited amount of story archetypes (the goals the heroes can pursue). There are about 10-20 most common objectives that 90% of the stories revolve around. What makes an objective unique is the specifics of the story, all the other elements of the adventure idea that surround the objective.</p>\n<p>When you watch movies and read stories, learn to notice the objective the heroes are trying to pursue, and compile a list of your favorite ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are some of the most common objectives:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining some important item (McGuffin), creature, person, or information.<br>\n(Train robberies, fetch quests, rescue missions, spy missions, capturing fugitives.)</li>\n<li>Killing/defeating a Villain or a dangerous monster who's up to no good.<br>\n(Horror movies, superhero movies, many sci-fi and fantasy movies.)</li>\n<li>Traveling to some distant location through dangerous territory, or ending up in a dangerous place and trying to survive and return home.<br>\n(Most adventure stories).</li>\n<li>Solving mysteries, finding out the truth.<br>\n(Most detective and mystery stories).</li>\n<li>Invading, Defending, or Escaping a location.<br>\n(Heists, prison breaks, many action movies).</li>\n<li>Convincing/manipulating people, gaining power through non-violent means.<br>\n(Intrigue, drama).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(or preventing a villain from doing one of the above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/files/objective-archetypes.pdf\">Here</a> you can see the full list of the objectives I have compiled. You can go through the list and try applying each of the ideas to your premise, that is a sure way to generate a lot of new and interesting story ideas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"premise-based-objectives\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#premise-based-objectives\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Premise-Based Objectives</h2>\n<p>Very often the objective will grow naturally out of the story idea you have developed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start with a Villain</strong> - come up with an idea for a villain, and figure out what it is that they want that the heroes must try to prevent.</li>\n<li><strong>Start with the Setting</strong> - what's wrong with the world the heroes are living in, what must be fixed?</li>\n<li><strong>Start with the Supernatural Element</strong> - some kind of magic, spell, technology, or a creature is causing problems, and the story is about resolving those problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the time when you have any idea, it's possible to figure out what kind of Objective it naturally leads to. Is that something heroes want? Is that something they fear? Is it causing some problems they must solve?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Villain - Crazy scientist obsessed with world domination.<br>\nObjective - stop him from performing his dangerous experiment.</li>\n<li>Setting - a dystopian world where the good has won, and is now ruthlessly oppressing the evil.<br>\nObjective - incite the monster rebellion and lead it against the Paladin army.</li>\n<li>Supernatural Element - a magic Trident used to control the Kraken.<br>\nObjective - steal it from the Pirate Lord who's currently using it to control the seas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"difficulties\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#difficulties\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Difficulties</h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to make the Objective more interesting is to add some restriction to it that makes it more difficult:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem must be solved using social/political means only.</li>\n<li>Problem must be solved stealthily, secretly, undercover.</li>\n<li>Problem must be solved under time pressure.</li>\n<li>Players must avoid violence, collateral damage.</li>\n<li>Players must compete with the rivals.</li>\n<li>Players must cooperate with the enemy.</li>\n<li>Players have incomplete/false information.</li>\n<li>Players have limited resources/preparation.</li>\n<li>Players must do it while protecting someone.</li>\n<li>Players must do it under scrutiny/supervision, bound by strict rules/laws.</li>\n<li>Target must be unharmed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"developing-your-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#developing-your-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Developing your Ideas</h2>\n<p>Now you have countless ways of finding adventure ideas, and strategies to create infinite combinations of them. You know how to come up with an exciting premise for your story, and an objective for your players to accomplish, which makes the process of creating the rest of the adventure very straightforward and easy.</p>\n<p>The next step is to make a list of 5-10 ideas, pick your favorite one, and develop it into a story. To do that, you can use the <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template\">brainstorming template</a> - it will guide you through the process of turning your idea into a story.</p>\n<p>I also wrote an adventure writing course, which is available for free <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy\">here</a>.

One evocative detail\nAdd one specific detail to engage your players' imagination and help their minds to build a vivid picture of the setting.\n\n<!--\nDescribe a detail of the room that isn't important, but ads flavour and deepens the verisimilitude of the place.\n\nAim to engage senses other than vision, or make the world feel alive by describing some activity in the scene.\n> - roaring waterfall\n> - > - The birds call above you\n> - > - Broken glass is crunching under your boots.\n-->\n\n- **Sound**\n> - The fire is cheerfully crackling in the fireplace.\n> - The animal sounds grow quieter as you go deeper into the forest.\n> - The sounds of turning pages and frantic scribbling fill the classroom.\n- **Smell**\n> - A damp, musty odor lingers in the air.\n> - Scent of fine leather comes from the furniture.\n> - Delicious smell of a vegetable stew is coming from the kitchen.\n- **Physical sensation**\n> - The cave walls feel cold and slick to the touch.\n> - Your clothes feel cold and damp, drenched in the rain.\n> - The expensive rug feels soft and comfortable under your feet.\n> - Gusts of wind threaten to blow you off the slippery bridge into the abyss.\n> - Scorching heat evaporates your sweat faster than your body can produce it.\n- **Movement**\n> - Rain lashes at the window.\n> - Birds fly in the air above you.\n> - Waterfall roars as it tumbles down the edge of the cliff.\n> - The wind picks up the falling leaves, making them dance in small whirlwinds\n\n<!--\n, action, animated detail**\n-->\n\n### 3. List actionable things\nFinally, direct your players' attention to the most notable things in the area, everything they can interact with or investigate, things that will influence their behavior.\n\n> - The walls are covered in strange runes.\n> - An enormous bear is sleeping in the corner.\n> - An ancient tome is floating in the air, glowing faintly.\n\nDescribe the most important thing last because otherwise the players will immediately focus on that and won't pay attention to the rest of the description.\n\n<!--\n\n Describe the most important thing in the room. Is there a feature that dominates the centre of the room? Are there orcs? Pick whatever the thing is that will influence player's behaviour.\n\n- Overall mood\n> - The place feels lonely and long-abandoned\n\n**Bonus 5th Sentence: Overall Feeling or Sense**. This is optional, and goes between Sentences 3 and 4. It's used to impart a feeling onto the players, like something they'd be able to infer from their surroundings.\n\n\"You get an eerie sense of loneliness\" \"Whatever this place was, it must have been important\" \"You feel like you're on hallowed ground\"\n\n**Improv Homework**. It's a lot easier to improv if you have a set structure. You assignment is to practice describing scenes when you're out of game. Describe things on the street, in the coffee shop, at school. Go to somewhere more out of the way like a park, river, forest, etc. Good luck and have fun with these!\n\n-->","html":"<p>Are you struggling to describe settings and locations in your games?
