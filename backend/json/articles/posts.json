The sequence of all the events is called a **Plot**.\n\nAn **Event** is a meaningful change in the character’s life, the thing that happens during the story that transforms the world from one state into another.\n\nDuring the story, the main character (**protagonist**) goes through a series of events, each of them _taking him closer to, or farther away from_ his **Goal**.\n\nThis series of events culminates in a **Climax** — the major, most important event of a story, **the moment when the protagonist achieves his goal** (or, sometimes, fails to achieve it).\n\nThe climax is what the story is about:\n\n-   Frodo drops the ring into the Mount Doom\n-   Luke destroys the Death Star\n-   Neo defeats the Agent Smith\n\nA story is divided into 3 Acts.\n\nThe **first act** is about the protagonist’s regular life being _disrupted_ by some event. This event is called **Inciting Incident** (I'll refer to it as IInc).\n\nIInc is the main reason the story has happened, the thing that kicks off a series of events that lead to climax.\n\nIInc gives the protagonist a _challenge_, creates a **Goal** — the thing the hero will be trying to achieve for the rest of the story. Often, IInc is the result of a _problem_ created by the antagonist.\n\n- Gandalf gives Frodo the Ring he will have to drop into Mount Doom.\n- Luke hears the message from Princess Leia about the blueprints he must use to destroy the Death Star.\n- Neo meets Morpheus who will tell him about the Matrix, which he will have to destroy to liberate humanity.\n\nThe first act culminates in the **First Turning Point** (TP1).\n\nTP1 is the moment when _the hero decides to go on an adventure, makes a conscious decision to engage with the story, and begins pursuing his goal_.\n\n- Frodo leaves the Shire\n- Luke's parents are killed\n- Neo takes the red pill\n\nThe **second act** is about the series of escalating events (successes and failures) which happen as the protagonist struggles to achieve his goal.\n\nThe hero pursues his goal, and _overcomes the obstacles_ set by the antagonist. From his victories and mistakes he _learns lessons_ about the world, and gains powers.\n\nAs the hero moves further, the stakes rise, his commitment to the goal increases, he has to apply more effort and take bigger and bigger risks to move forward.\n\nIn the middle of the second act, the protagonist goes through the **Mid Point** (MP) — the **point of no return**. He swims past the middle of the river, and now turning back would be more difficult than reaching the other shore.\n\nThe stakes continue to rise, until the protagonist has to **risk everything** in his biggest attempt to win. _He engages in the **final battle** against the antagonist, and puts everything on the line._\n\nThe second act culminates in the **Second Turning Point** (TP2) — the moment when the hero’s biggest attempt _fails_, when **all is lost**, the goal is no longer attainable, the antagonist seems to win, and the protagonist has been _defeated_.\n\nThe **third act** is about the final battle and its outcome.\n\nDefeated, half-dead hero _learns his biggest lesson from his worst failure._\n\nThis is usually when the biggest _twist_ happens. The hero _sees the truth_. Comes up with a brilliant creative solution, understands his mistake, realizes who was the murderer all along, finds the ultimate weapon, etc. This is what will enable him to turn his defeat into a victory.\n\n- Harry holds a basilisk fang\n- Neo sees the Matrix code\n\nArmed with this knowledge he gathers all of his strength, and takes the final effort to turn things around, to win the battle.\n\nThe hero defeats the antagonist and **finally achieves his goal**.\n\n# Story Essence\n\nWhat **is** a story? Why is it told? What lies at its core?\n\nWhen the world undergoes _change_ from one state to another, this process is called an “**Event**”.\n\nThe point of storytelling is to relay the **experience** of an event. People listen to stories to experience an exciting and meaningful event, understand it’s reasons, and learn from it.\n\n> **Story** is a description of an **Event** (change of value) and the underlying reasons for that change.\n\n### Climax\n\nA story consists of _a series of smaller events_, leading up to and culminating at **Climax** — the big and important event, the reason for telling a story. The Climax is the moment such Event happens.\n\nThe **Climax** is the key to the story.\n\nWhen you are writing a story, climax is the biggest thing you are looking for, and the most challenging thing to figure out. Once you know the climax — you have your story, because all of the key story elements are connected to it.\n\n### Protagonist\n\nWe experience the story through the eyes of the protagonist, he is our _avatar_ into the story world.\n\nThe Climax is a direct result of a deliberate action by the protagonist. The protagonist is a person who has a **goal**, and has made a **choice** to pursue it. The Climax is the moment when the protagonist achieves (or fails to achieve) his goal.\n\nAs the hero struggles to pursue his goal, he gains experience. He understands the way the world works and the reasons for that. He learns lessons, and we learn these lessons through him.\n\n### Controlling Idea\n\nControlling Idea (CI) is the _underlying reason_ for the change that happens, the underlying nature of the world we are trying to explain through our story. It is the answer to **why** the event has happened.\n\nCI is an **abstract** idea, which is being expressed through **concrete** events and actions.\n\nTo put it simply — it is a “moral”, a philosophy that is being expressed. For example, children’s fables are simple metaphors for expressing simple ideas (“lying is bad”, “be nice”, etc).\n\nCI is a “lesson” that the protagonist learns about the nature of the world that enables him to accomplish his goal.\n\nUsually, CI is expressed as a flaw that prevents the protagonist from achieving his goal, it is a “lesson” he learns during the story.\n\n### Relationships between the story elements\n\nWhen you are writing a story, the climax is the key element you are looking for. When you know the climax — you have a story, and until you know it — you don’t.\n\nAll the other elements of a story are connected to the climax, they add up to it, and are defined in relation to it. If you know the climax — you know all of the crucial elements. Here’s how elements relate to climax and to each other:\n\n![](/post/story-structure/story-structure.png)\n\n- **Climax** is a moment where the story’s main **Event** happens, that makes it the most crucial scene. Story is written about the Event, thus **Story = Event = Climax**.\n- Climax is the moment when the protagonist achieves his **Goal**. That means that if you know the climax — you know the protagonist’s goal, and vice versa. **Climax = Goal.**\n- **Inciting Incident** (IInc) is, by definition, the moment when the character acquires his goal. Usually, it is a **problem** created by the **antagonist**, a problem which the hero will struggle to solve during the whole story, and will finally solve by defeating the antagonist at the climax. That means that if **you know IInc = you know the goal**, and **you know the goal = you know the climax**.\n\nAnd when you know IInc, goal, and a climax — it is easy to figure out everything else:\n\n- At **Turning Point 1** (TP1), the hero makes a decision to pursue the goal he acquired at IInc and starts on his journey.\n- At **Mid Point**, the hero realizes he can't turn back, he has a better chance of achieving his goal than going back to the way things were before.\n- And at **TP2**, the hero seems to fail and lose his goal, it is simply the reverse of what happens at climax.\n\nNow the **antagonist** is a character whose function is to prevent the hero from achieving his goal by throwing obstacles on his way.\n\nCharacter’s **friend/sidekick** is a character whose function is to help the hero to achieve his goal (and to be a source of information — talk to the hero to provide exposition, explain to us what’s going on, render his thoughts, etc.)\n\n**Love interest** is an extra motivation for a hero to achieve his goal, a source of extra complications/conflict, and a _reward_ he gets for winning.\n\nThe hero’s **Flaw** is a mistake he makes, an internal quality that prevents him from achieving his goal, and creates **internal conflict**.\n\nThe **Controlling Idea** (the “moral” of a story) is a **lesson** the hero learns by overcoming his internal flaw, the lesson that enables him to defeat the antagonist and achieve his goal.\n\nThat way, as you can see, all elements are connected through the **goal** to the story’s **climax**. Any can be _discovered_ if you know the climax, and when you know only some of the elements but not all — you can discover climax by following these connections.\n\n# Story Writing Process\n\nNow that I’ve talked about story structure, story essence, and connection between climax and other story elements — I will talk about the story writing process.\n\n## Story elements\n![](/post/story-structure/story-elements.png)\n\nThere are 4 crucial elements you need to know about your story:\n\n- **Setting** — the world of a story.\n- **Characters** — protagonist, antagonist, others.\n- **Event** — the climax, the event the story is about.\n- **Controlling Idea** (CI) — the “moral” of a story, the abstract philosophy you want to express by giving people the concrete experience of the story.\n\nTogether they form a **High Concept** (HC) — the main story idea, original and interesting concept you can express in a few words.\n\nWhen you know what these elements are — you can find the key structural points (IInc, TP1, MP, TP2, Climax) of a story, and develop a Plot.\n\nThat will give you a pretty clear and straightforward idea of what your **3 Acts** are about. Once you know that — you can break the acts into scenes , and create **Outline**. And then use that outline(list of scenes) to simply expand it into writing.\n\n## Process\n\nYou find these elements by **asking and answering questions**. In practice any of the elements can be an initial idea/inspiration, the process is chaotic, it involves jumping back and forth between questions, tweaking, randomness, serendipity, imagination, etc. The following is an idealized, orderly version of a process.\n\n### Character in a situation\n\nIt makes sense to begin by finding an interesting **setting**, and once you know where your story takes place it is easier to find an interesting **character**.\n\nI also call it “SciFi Premise”, because SciFi/Fantasy tend to revolve around worldbuilding and unusual characters in interesting situations.\n\n### Problem\n\nOnce you know the setting and characters, your biggest goal is to find your climax.\n\nIt is difficult to come up with the climax on its own, but as I’ve said, all the elements in the story are connected, and you can unravel all of them by starting with one.\n\nIn my experience, the easiest one to begin with is **IInc**, or, in other words, a **problem**.\n\nBecause once you have your character in a setting, you can answer the question “What can go wrong?”\n\nUsually this problem is caused by the antagonist, so if you can figure out who that is it may help you to find the problem.\n\n### Goal\n\nOnce you have your problem — you'll have your IInc, you know where your story has started.\n\nAnd, you'll immediately know that the character’s goal is to solve this problem.\n\nSo even if you don’t have a very idea of your climax — you know that your character will solve this problem at climax.\n\n### TP1, MP, TP2\n\nThen you can figure out TP1 — it is simply the point when the hero decides to pursue his goal.\n\nOnce you know that, you can imagine what difficulties may arise, and how things can escalate, and as they escalate more and more — you know your MP, and as they escalate even further — you can figure out the big final attempt at achieving his goal, and how it can go horribly wrong and fail.\n\n### Climax\n\nFinally, once you know the TP2 — the lowest point for the character — you can figure out how he will turn things around and solve everything at climax.\n\n### Steps\n\nHere’s a convenient list of questions to summarize it:\n\n-   **Setting**. What is the world of my story?\n-   **Characters**. Who are the characters?\n-   **Problem** (and Goal). What can go wrong? What problem will my character need to solve?\n-   **Engage**. How does the character begin pursuing his goal?\n-   **Escalate**. How can the problem get more difficult? What obstacles will the hero face?\n-   **Lose**. What is his final, most difficult, highest-stakes challenge, and how can it fail?\n-   **Turn** How can the hero turn his defeat into a victory? How does he solve the problem?\n\n### Explore\n\nOnce you know the things you are looking for, the main steps you need to take — you search for them by asking questions, thinking, writing.\n\nUsually it is hard to write the story completely top-down (start from outline, find key points, and break things down until you have individual scenes), and it is hard to do it bottom-up (just sitting down, writing, and going wherever it takes you). So I think that the best way is to combine both options and jump back and forth. You think about the outline, you ask questions, you sit down to write, then go back to correcting the outline.\n\nIf you find yourself unable to answer some of the questions, I suggest writing a list of 5 possible options, not the best ones, just something that could barely fit, and then pick the one you like the most.\n\nAnother useful idea at this point is to just set yourself a goal to write a certain number of words (250 or 500 works well). When you are doing that, you should not think about the outline, or the story structure, or theory - just type words, this process will help you to find the answers and new ideas.\n\n## Resources\n\n<!--\nI have developed a [story template](https://nulis.io/template/Story?src=writerscoop) based on these ideas — a tool that allows you to organize all of this information, and takes you through the process of writing a story using this method.

So I think that the best way is to combine both options and jump back and forth. You think about the outline, you ask questions, you sit down to write, then go back to correcting the outline.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself unable to answer some of the questions, I suggest writing a list of 5 possible options, not the best ones, just something that could barely fit, and then pick the one you like the most.</p>\n<p>Another useful idea at this point is to just set yourself a goal to write a certain number of words (250 or 500 works well). When you are doing that, you should not think about the outline, or the story structure, or theory - just type words, this process will help you to find the answers and new ideas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#resources\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Resources</h2>\n<p>To go deeper into this subject and learn more, I highly recommend the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Story-Structure-Substance-Principles-Screenwriting-ebook/dp/B0042FZVOY\">Story</a> by Robert McKee, this incredible <a href=\"http://www.audible.com.au/pd/Health-Personal-Development/Screenwriting-for-Hollywood-Audiobook/B00FO19USI\">lecture on screenwriting</a> by Michael Hauge, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/WriteAboutDragons\">series of lectures</a> by Brandon Sanderson, and <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy\">my course about creating adventures</a>.</p>","body":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    img: \"img\",\n    strong: \"strong\",\n    em: \"em\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    h1: \"h1\",\n    blockquote: \"blockquote\",\n    h3: \"h3\",\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    a: \"a\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.img, {\n        src: \"/post/story-structure/story-structure.png\",\n        alt: \"\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"A story is made out of a series of \", _jsx(_components.strong, {\n        children: \"events\"\n      }), \".

If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game.\n\n<br/>\n\n<div className=\"columns\">\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Play to find out what happens\nDo things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”.\n\n### Yes, and\nEmbrace other players’ ideas and build on top of them. Don’t shut down ideas. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for the other characters to shine.  \n\n### Share the Spotlight\nAvoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation. Help the quieter players to feel included - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.\n\n### Actively contribute ideas to the story\nDon’t be afraid to add information to the story. Try to describe things vividly, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the the missing information, help to create a story that makes sense. \n\n### Advance the Plot\nHelp the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.\n\n### Be an active player\nDon't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others. \n\nPositive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.\n\n### Engage Quiet Players\nIf you notice that someone hasn't spoken up in awhile - start an in-character conversation with them, for example ask them what they think about the current situation.\n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Stay in character\nTry to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.\n\n### Develop your Character\nWhat are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?\n\n### Goals and Motivations\nFigure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?\n\n### Explore the Relationships\nHow does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?\n\nCreate interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?\n\n### Allow yourself to feel\nThis game can get really amazing when you allow yourself to really feel what your character feels in the moment. When you feel safe to express emotions around your friends, and really care about your character and theirs, you will have some amazing and unforgettable moments.\n\n### Make Friends\nGet to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.\n\n</div>\n</div>","html":"<p>Show your players this list of tips they can follow to get the most out of your games and help everyone have a great experience.</p>\n<p>It helped me to make our games much more fun, and it will help you and your players as well!</p>\n<h2 id=\"roleplaying-guidelines\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#roleplaying-guidelines\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Roleplaying Guidelines</h2>\n<p>Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our games.

But for the past couple of years, I have been running [adventure brainstorming sessions](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) (a few GMs get on a voice chat and we write an adventure in a couple of hours), we have brainstormed dozens of adventures and playtested/published quite a few. I have learned a lot, and in this post, I will teach you everything I know about creating ideas that are exciting for you and for your players, in a reasonable amount of time, without ever hitting a creative block.\n\nIf you're struggling to come up with good ideas, by the end of this guide you will have more ideas than you know what to do with.\n\n# Start with a clear goal\n\nIntentional constraints dramatically simplify the creative process, so the first step is to narrow the infinite space of possible ideas down to something your brain can handle without entering the choice paralysis mode.\n\nThe more specific you can get - the better. I recommend that you at least pick a genre and a couple of adjectives describing the kind of adventure you want to create:\n\n> \n- Lighthearted comedy-heist\n- Post-apocalyptic fantasy\n- Intense spy thriller\n- Gritty western\n- Sci-fi horror\n\n# The four components of an Idea\n\n A good adventure idea is usually based on one of the following four elements, or an interesting combination of them:\n\n- **Important Objective** - an exciting problem that your players will try to solve, the goal they'll try to achieve, or an evil plan they'll try to prevent.\n- **Interesting Setting** - world and locations where the adventure takes place, with a unique twist (unusual location, nature, inhabitants, culture, etc.)\n- **Cool Characters** - a cool antagonist the players will have to defeat. With interesting goals, motivations, occupation, appearance, personality, powers, and the problems they're causing. Also, to a lesser extent, some other characters players will meet.\n- **Supernatural Element** - interesting magics, technologies, items, or creatures.\n\nYour idea can grow out of any one of these elements. Can you think of an exciting goal, setting, character, or magic you would like to build your story around?\n\nIf you aren't sure which one to start with - try making a couple of ideas in each category, and then mixing them together (the ideas should be unrelated to each other, try to make them as different from each other as possible).\n\nTake a look at some examples:\n\n> \n- **Setting + Supernatural**:  \nA lavish castle where all inhabitants have been mind-controlled by the brain slugs.\n- **Setting + Problem**:  \nA grotesque experiment has escaped from the mad scientist's laboratory.\n- **Supernatural + Problem**:  \nA love potion has leaked into the water supply.\n- **Supernatural + Goal**:  \nYou have been hired to obtain a lock of hair from the elusive Sasquatch.\n- **Character + Setting**:  \nA noble Paladin has arrived at the Pirate City to bring law and order.\n- **Character + Problem**:  \nA socially awkward prince will lose his claim to the throne unless he finds a wife by next Friday.\n- **Character + Supernatural**:  \nA pompous King has been turned into a Rat by his evil Vizier.\n\n### Bottom-Up ideas\nIf you have an idea for some very specific part of the story (you want your players to fight a certain monster, visit a certain location, find a specific magical artifact, etc.) - you can grow a story around that. Expand the idea and see if it leads you to one or few of the core components I've outlined above.\n\n>\n- I want my players to attend the King's feast:\n\t- Problem: They learn that someone has poisoned the food.\n\t- Supernatural: The cooked boar has left a ghost who is determined to ruin the feast.\n- I have a cool swamp battle-map:\n\t- Setting: The Swamplands of No Return.\n\t- Character: Swamp Witch who holds a Terrible Secret. \n- I want my players to find the Scroll of Sweet Slithering Snakes:\n\t- Character: It is being held by a brilliant, powerful, and extremely paranoid wizard.\n\t- Setting: It has been lost in the Basilisk's lair.\n\n# Blank Page vs Lego Blocks\nIt is difficult and unnecessary to try to invent everything from scratch, just by staring at the blank page and trying to make something up by thinking really hard. I struggled with this a lot, it was one of the main causes of my writer's block.\n\nInstead of staring into the emptiness of a blank page, creativity should feel like playing with lego blocks. You take existing ideas and tropes you're already familiar with, and try to recombine them in new ways, or change them and turn them into something new.\n\n### Picking Apart Stories\nYou obtain the lego blocks to play with by picking apart your favorite stories - movies, TV shows, books, games, comics, and so on.\n\nLook through the list of interesting stories, and extract the idea components out of them:\n\n- What did the main character want in this story, is there an interesting problem they were trying to solve?\n- Does the story take place in an interesting setting?\n- What are some of the coolest, most memorable characters that you've seen in this story?\n- Does the story explore some interesting magics or technologies, does it involve some supernatural creatures?\n\nNot all stories will have all the four elements, but in most of them at least one of these components is really strong:\n\n> **Objective**:  \n- Solve a murder despite memory loss (Memento)  \n- Diffuse the bomb before the bus stops moving (Speed)  \n- Defeat a skyscraper full of terrorists by yourself (Die Hard)  \n- Teach a young girl to kill so she could avenge her family (Leon)  \n\n\n> **Setting**:  \n- Hogwarts  \n- The Matrix  \n- Wasteland (Fallout)  \n- Jurassic Park  \n\n\n> **Character**:  \n- Walter White  \n- Jack Sparrow  \n- Indiana Jones  \n- Ace Ventura  \n\n\n> **Supernatural**:   \n- Time Loop (Groundhog Day)  \n- Sentient Toys (Toy Story)  \n- Body Switching (Freaky Friday)  \n- Mech Suit (Iron Man)  \n\nor a combination of these components is really interesting or unexpected:\n\n>  \n- Shared dreams + Heist = Inception  \n- Romeo and Juliet + RMS Titanic = Titanic  \n- Bank Heist + Zombies = Army of The Dead  \n- Time travel + Undo the Butterfly Effect = Back to the Future   \n- Sentient Animals + Avenge your Father = Lion King  \n- Time Travel + Robot Rebellion = Terminator  \n- Escape from Monster + Xenomorph = Alien  \n- Timid teacher + Become a Crime Lord = Breaking Bad  \n\nBuild a library of these elements. Many storytellers keep this library in their heads, but I recommend using [this google docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgasFqcKVG0f0jOwBRaHYO6dYRSkgdx-UgtXXk3ictI/) to create a digital library of ideas.\n\nStart collecting ideas. Whenever you see a movie/book/game that you enjoy, extract the ideas you liked the most, and add them to your collection.\n\nThis library is like a big box of lego blocks - when it's time to create an adventure, you can use them to assemble a new and interesting combination of ideas that you haven't seen before.\n\n> For example, let's take a few elements from the lists above and recombine them into something new:  \n> \n- **Romeo and Juliet + Bank Heist**    \nA love-struck teenager asks the players to help him commit a bank heist to impress the father of the girl he's in love with, a crime boss of a powerful mafia family.  \n- **Sentient Animals + Ace Ventura**   \nA crazy druid with the personality of Ace Ventura leads his army of sentient flying squirrels to take revenge on the lumberjack village that's destroying his forest.\n- **Robot Rebellion + Hogwarts**   \nThe animated suits of armor and the stone gargoyles have been hijacked by unknown magic and are wrecking havoc on a magic castle. The players must rescue the royal family from the castle that came alive.\n- **Titanic + Zombies**   \nA zombie outbreak on the ship leads to a catastrophe, players must survive on a sinking ship full of zombies.\n\nThe trick is to realize that there's already an endless amount of creative ideas out there, made for you by thousands of storytellers, and these ideas are already good (since they're taken from the stories you like). You can just take the good ideas out of context, and make them different and unique by changing the genre, details, and combining them with other creative ideas in new ways. Then all you have to do is to assemble all these new ideas into a story that makes sense.\n\n### Adapting Stories\nThe easiest way to come up with an adventure idea is to just adapt one of your favorite stories, changing only a few details.\n\n> **Alien in a Fantasy world**  \nStop the cruel power-hungry emperor who tries to build himself an army by breeding dangerous Xenomorph-like monsters.\n\n> **Die Hard in a Magic Castle**  \nVampires took over the magic school, you're the only ones who can rescue their hostages before they get turned into vampires.\n\n> **Honey I Shrunk The Kids**  \nEvil witch poisons the players with a shrinking potion, they must escape and travel through her (now enormous) magic hut to the top shelf where the enlargement potion is stored.\n\nThe best way to make such adventures more original is to adapt ideas from different genres and mediums. If you're writing a fantasy adventure - adapt an idea from your favorite Sci-Fi TV show (like Rick and Morty or Firefly), from a game (like Last of Us), or a musical (like Nightmare Time by Starkid).\n\n### Recombining the Elements\nCombine two interesting ideas together to create something new, mix and match the tropes, putting them together in different ways (like playing with lego blocks):\n\n> **Sentient Animals + Lord of the Rings**  \nPlayers play as mice who have stumbled upon The One Ring, and are now humanity's last hope.\n\n> **Rescue Mission + Scary Monster**  \nThe players are hired by a cooky wizard to find and return his runaway pet. His pet is a zombie chimera made out of fury and rage.\n\n> **Pirates + Floating Islands**  \nDefend a floating pirate town (think Tortuga) being attacked by a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”.\n\nNotice that the individual ideas don't have to be that interesting or original - you can just lift them from other stories, which is very easy to do. The unique combination of two simple ideas is what makes your story creative, unique, and original.\n\n### Changing the Elements\nAnother way to build on top of the ideas and make them more original is to change them in interesting ways.\n\nTo change an idea, you need to take one of its key elements and reverse it (do the opposite), exaggerate it (take it to the extreme), or replace it with an entirely different element (idea from a completely different story or genre).\n\n> **Reverse the Goal: Rescue the Dragon from the Princess**  \nA cruel princess has kidnapped the baby dragon's mom, and is forcing her to fight in a coliseum. Help to rescue the big mama dragon.\n\n> **Reverse the Key Character Trait: Evil Batman**  \nProtect the city from a ruthless high-tech vigilante driven by his misguided code of honor.\n\n> **Change the Setting: Typical Train Heist story, set on a Zeppelin**  \nRescue an innocent person being delivered by Zeppelin to serve her life sentence in prison.\n\n> **Exaggerate the Supernatural Element**  \nSolve the disappearance of cows in a village where **everyone** is secretly a werewolf.\n\n## Combining Your Own Ideas\nMake a list of 5-10 ideas using the methods above, and then combine/reverse/exaggerate some of *these* ideas to make something even more unique and interesting.\n\n>\n- **Zombies on the Titanic + Ace Ventura**  \nThe zombies have been released by a crazy zombie-rights activist who has steered the ship into the island where he's planning to build his own zombie utopia.\n- **Runaway Chimera + Pirates of the Floating Island**  \nPlayers must protect the escaped gargoyle (a protected species) from the crew of flying pirates who are determined to capture it.\n- **Shrinking Potion + The King's Feast**  \nKing's enemies have added the shrinking potion into wine, and now players must help the king to fight off the rebellion despite being the size of an ant.\n\n## Using Images and Adventure Prompts\nJust like extracting ideas from books and movies, you can extract them from artworks, which are a goldmine of useful ideas. [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/) has a lot of beautiful artworks, and the functionality that allows you to categorize them and build collections. You can install the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artstation-discover/ghkbedmkakkdhfkhchadmkhlflnafocm?hl=en) that randomly shows you a new artwork every time you open a new tab in the browser. Add the most inspiring images to your collection, and then use them as prompts to come up with ideas.\n\nI have already built a pretty big collection of cool ideas, and created a tool that recombines them for you automatically. Try using the [Adventure Prompts Tool](https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts) - generate random prompts and try to pitch a few ideas based on the combinations of these elements.\n\nI recommend setting a 2-minute timer, and challenging yourself to pitch a story idea based on whatever random prompts you end up with. These pitches often end up surprisingly interesting and creative, and in 20 minutes you can create 10 such pitches you can add to your list of ideas.\n\nIt is much easier and more fun to do this together with a friend - take turns generating prompts and pitching ideas, then build on top of each other's ideas using the methods described above.\n\n## More Good Sources of Story Ideas\nAside from passively collecting ideas from the movies you're watching and the books you're reading, you can actively research ideas. Browse the lists of stories until you find an element that gets you excited, and build an adventure around it.\n\n- [IMDB list of top movies and TV Shows](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature,tv_series&user_rating=6.0,10.0&sort=num_votes,desc&count=250).   \nUse [advanced search](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/) to narrow them down by genre, rating, etc.\n- Lists of TV episodes on Wikipedia:   \n[Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29#Episodes)  \n[Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Disenchantment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment_%28TV_series%29#Episodes)  \n[X-Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_%28season_1%29#Episodes)  \n[Scooby Doo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scooby-Doo!_Mystery_Incorporated_episodes)  \n- [TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighConcept)\n- [Adventure Lookup](https://adventurelookup.com/adventures)\n- [/r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/)\n- [Big list of RPG plots](https://kimberleycresswell.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the-big-list-of-rpg-plots.pdf)\n- [Follow RPG](http://www.lamemage.com/follow/).\n\n# Primary Objective\nYour adventure idea isn't complete until you have figured out the Primary Objective your players will try to pursue - a **Problem** they will be trying to solve or a **Goal** they will be trying to accomplish.\n\nThe Primary Objective is the **core of your story**, the most important element you need to figure out. Once you know the Objective - everything else will fall into place, because almost all the other elements of the adventure are defined in relation to the Objective:\n\n- **Adventure Hook** is the moment at the beginning of the adventure where the players encounter the Problem they must solve or establish the Goal they will try to achieve.\n- **Antagonist** is the primary force that stands in the way of the players, their goal is the opposite of the heroes' Objective.\n- **Challenges and Encounters** are the obstacles that the players will need to overcome on their path to the Objective.\n- **Intriguing Mysteries** are bits and pieces of information the players will gather throughout their adventure that are required for them to accomplish their goal.\n- **Surprising Twist** is the moment in the middle of the adventure when the players' Objective changes in some way - they realize that it's not what they once thought it was, or some complication makes it much more difficult to achieve.\n- **The Climax** of the adventure is the moment when the Objective is resolved, when the players succeed at accomplishing their goal (or, rarely, fail to do so and lose).\n\nResolving the Objective will be the single most important event in the story, it will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the \"final battle\" revolves around.\n\n## Stories are about Problem Solving\nStories and roleplaying games are fundamentally about creative problem-solving. \n\nAdventure Ideas are fundamentally problems. They create an exciting, challenging, important goal for the players to accomplish.\n\nThis is the fundamental \"game loop\" of an RPG - the GM puts an interesting problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it.\n\nBig problems are broken down into smaller Challenges. In every scene the characters try to solve a small problem, their successes take them closer to achieving their goal, the setbacks and complications take them farther away from that goal.\n\nPlayers encounter a big problem at the beginning of the story, they go through a series of challenges that add up to ultimately solving the problem at the Climax of the story. \n\nThis gives the players a sense of progress, makes them feel like their actions are meaningful, make an impact on the world, add up to some larger purpose. The Primary Objective is that purpose.\n\n## What makes a Good Primary Objective\nThe Primary Objective is a **specific thing the players must do** in order to succeed in their quest. A specific action they must take that will resolve the main conflict.\n\nPrimary Objective must be:  \n\n- **High Stakes** - players should care about accomplishing it. It should be very meaningful and important to the characters and to the world they live in. Players should have a good reason to pursue it, whatever it takes.\n- **Exciting** - the problem should be interesting to solve, the goal should be desirable to achieve. Players will spend the whole adventure doing everything in their power to accomplish this, so it should be something fun to participate in.\n- **Difficult** - the objective should be difficult to accomplish. It will be the main source of challenges and conflict in your story, it will create a lot of struggle for the characters, and you want your players to feel epic and heroic when they succeed.\n\n> **Objective Examples**:  \n- Kill the dragon to save the village.  \n- Break out an innocent from an unassailable prison.  \n- Stop the Villain from opening a portal into the Demon Dimension.  \n- Solve the crime to prevent a war between the two kingdoms.  \n\n## Objectives and Villains\nObjectives come in two types, like two sides of the same coin:\n\n> **Players really want something, and the villain stands in their way.**  \n- Rescue a princess from a dragon.  \n- Journey to a distant location and find treasure.  \n- Broker peace between warring kingdoms.  \n- Perform the heist of the century.  \n\n> **Villain really wants something, and players must do whatever it takes to stop them.**  \n- Prevent the villain from performing a terrible world-ending ritual.  \n- Make sure the villain won't get their hands on a powerful artifact.  \n- The Villain wants to kill or kidnap someone, and the players must protect them.  \n- The Villain is pursuing the players, and they must escape to survive.  \n\nSo any idea you have for an Objective is actually two ideas - it is either something the players want to pursue (\"Kill a Terrible Monster\"), or must prevent the villain from obtaining (\"Protect an Adorable Creature from the evil Hunter.\"). \n\nLooking at the Objectives this way doubles the amount of ideas you have, and helps you to come up with interesting and unusual stories (by swapping the Heroes and the Villains, telling the story from the perspective of the Antagonist).\n\n## Objective Archetypes\nJust as described above, taking ideas from your favorite stories (and changing them a bit) is one of the best ways to come up with your objective.\n\nUnlike the other story elements, the objectives actually tend to be pretty generic - there's a limited amount of story archetypes (the goals the heroes can pursue). There are about 10-20 most common objectives that 90% of the stories revolve around. What makes an objective unique is the specifics of the story, all the other elements of the adventure idea that surround the objective.\n\nWhen you watch movies and read stories, learn to notice the objective the heroes are trying to pursue, and compile a list of your favorite ones.\n\n> Here are some of the most common objectives:\n> \n- Obtaining some important item (McGuffin), creature, person, or information.  \n(Train robberies, fetch quests, rescue missions, spy missions, capturing fugitives.)\n- Killing/defeating a Villain or a dangerous monster who's up to no good.  \n(Horror movies, superhero movies, many sci-fi and fantasy movies.)\n- Traveling to some distant location through dangerous territory, or ending up in a dangerous place and trying to survive and return home.  \n(Most adventure stories).\n- Solving mysteries, finding out the truth.  \n(Most detective and mystery stories).\n- Invading, Defending, or Escaping a location.  \n(Heists, prison breaks, many action movies).\n- Convincing/manipulating people, gaining power through non-violent means.   \n(Intrigue, drama).\n\n(or preventing a villain from doing one of the above).\n\n[Here](https://rpgadventures.io/files/objective-archetypes.pdf) you can see the full list of the objectives I have compiled. You can go through the list and try applying each of the ideas to your premise, that is a sure way to generate a lot of new and interesting story ideas.\n\n## Premise-Based Objectives\nVery often the objective will grow naturally out of the story idea you have developed.\n\n- **Start with a Villain** - come up with an idea for a villain, and figure out what it is that they want that the heroes must try to prevent.\n- **Start with the Setting** - what's wrong with the world the heroes are living in, what must be fixed?\n- **Start with the Supernatural Element** - some kind of magic, spell, technology, or a creature is causing problems, and the story is about resolving those problems.\n\nMost of the time when you have any idea, it's possible to figure out what kind of Objective it naturally leads to. Is that something heroes want? Is that something they fear? Is it causing some problems they must solve?\n\n> Examples:  \n- Villain - Crazy scientist obsessed with world domination.    \nObjective - stop him from performing his dangerous experiment.  \n- Setting - a dystopian world where the good has won, and is now ruthlessly oppressing the evil.    \nObjective - incite the monster rebellion and lead it against the Paladin army.  \n- Supernatural Element - a magic Trident used to control the Kraken.    \nObjective - steal it from the Pirate Lord who's currently using it to control the seas.  \n\n## Difficulties\nOne of the best ways to make the Objective more interesting is to add some restriction to it that makes it more difficult:\n\n>\n- Problem must be solved using social/political means only.\n- Problem must be solved stealthily, secretly, undercover.\n- Problem must be solved under time pressure.\n- Players must avoid violence, collateral damage.\n- Players must compete with the rivals.\n- Players must cooperate with the enemy.\n- Players have incomplete/false information.\n- Players have limited resources/preparation.\n- Players must do it while protecting someone.\n- Players must do it under scrutiny/supervision, bound by strict rules/laws.\n- Target must be unharmed.\n\n## Developing your Ideas\nNow you have countless ways of finding adventure ideas, and strategies to create infinite combinations of them. You know how to come up with an exciting premise for your story, and an objective for your players to accomplish, which makes the process of creating the rest of the adventure very straightforward and easy.\n\nThe next step is to make a list of 5-10 ideas, pick your favorite one, and develop it into a story. To do that, you can use the [brainstorming template](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template) - it will guide you through the process of turning your idea into a story.\n\nI also wrote an adventure writing course, which is available for free [here](https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy). In this course I share everything I know about creating adventures, and guide you through a straightforward step-by-step process to creating your own one-shot adventure. If you've enjoyed this post - you will really love the course.\n\nI hope you found this guide useful. If you have any questions, feedback on how I can make it better, or your own tips on creating adventure ideas - please leave them in the comments.","html":"<p>This is my in-depth step-by-step guide to coming up with endless amount of exciting adventure ideas that you and your players can't wait to play with.</p>\n<p>Coming up with ideas used to be extremely difficult for me, as I'm not a naturally creative person. But for the past couple of years, I have been running <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room\">adventure brainstorming sessions</a> (a few GMs get on a voice chat and we write an adventure in a couple of hours), we have brainstormed dozens of adventures and playtested/published quite a few. I have learned a lot, and in this post, I will teach you everything I know about creating ideas that are exciting for you and for your players, in a reasonable amount of time, without ever hitting a creative block.</p>\n<p>If you're struggling to come up with good ideas, by the end of this guide you will have more ideas than you know what to do with.</p>\n<h1 id=\"start-with-a-clear-goal\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#start-with-a-clear-goal\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Start with a clear goal</h1>\n<p>Intentional constraints dramatically simplify the creative process, so the first step is to narrow the infinite space of possible ideas down to something your brain can handle without entering the choice paralysis mode.</p>\n<p>The more specific you can get - the better. I recommend that you at least pick a genre and a couple of adjectives describing the kind of adventure you want to create:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Lighthearted comedy-heist</li>\n<li>Post-apocalyptic fantasy</li>\n<li>Intense spy thriller</li>\n<li>Gritty western</li>\n<li>Sci-fi horror</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-four-components-of-an-idea\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#the-four-components-of-an-idea\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The four components of an Idea</h1>\n<p>A good adventure idea is usually based on one of the following four elements, or an interesting combination of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Important Objective</strong> - an exciting problem that your players will try to solve, the goal they'll try to achieve, or an evil plan they'll try to prevent.</li>\n<li><strong>Interesting Setting</strong> - world and locations where the adventure takes place, with a unique twist (unusual location, nature, inhabitants, culture, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Cool Characters</strong> - a cool antagonist the players will have to defeat. With interesting goals, motivations, occupation, appearance, personality, powers, and the problems they're causing. Also, to a lesser extent, some other characters players will meet.</li>\n<li><strong>Supernatural Element</strong> - interesting magics, technologies, items, or creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your idea can grow out of any one of these elements. Can you think of an exciting goal, setting, character, or magic you would like to build your story around?</p>\n<p>If you aren't sure which one to start with - try making a couple of ideas in each category, and then mixing them together (the ideas should be unrelated to each other, try to make them as different from each other as possible).</p>\n<p>Take a look at some examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Setting + Supernatural</strong>:<br>\nA lavish castle where all inhabitants have been mind-controlled by the brain slugs.</li>\n<li><strong>Setting + Problem</strong>:<br>\nA grotesque experiment has escaped from the mad scientist's laboratory.</li>\n<li><strong>Supernatural + Problem</strong>:<br>\nA love potion has leaked into the water supply.</li>\n<li><strong>Supernatural + Goal</strong>:<br>\nYou have been hired to obtain a lock of hair from the elusive Sasquatch.</li>\n<li><strong>Character + Setting</strong>:<br>\nA noble Paladin has arrived at the Pirate City to bring law and order.</li>\n<li><strong>Character + Problem</strong>:<br>\nA socially awkward prince will lose his claim to the throne unless he finds a wife by next Friday.</li>\n<li><strong>Character + Supernatural</strong>:<br>\nA pompous King has been turned into a Rat by his evil Vizier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bottom-up-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#bottom-up-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bottom-Up ideas</h3>\n<p>If you have an idea for some very specific part of the story (you want your players to fight a certain monster, visit a certain location, find a specific magical artifact, etc.) - you can grow a story around that. Expand the idea and see if it leads you to one or few of the core components I've outlined above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I want my players to attend the King's feast:\n<ul>\n<li>Problem: They learn that someone has poisoned the food.</li>\n<li>Supernatural: The cooked boar has left a ghost who is determined to ruin the feast.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I have a cool swamp battle-map:\n<ul>\n<li>Setting: The Swamplands of No Return.</li>\n<li>Character: Swamp Witch who holds a Terrible Secret.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I want my players to find the Scroll of Sweet Slithering Snakes:\n<ul>\n<li>Character: It is being held by a brilliant, powerful, and extremely paranoid wizard.</li>\n<li>Setting: It has been lost in the Basilisk's lair.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"blank-page-vs-lego-blocks\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#blank-page-vs-lego-blocks\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Blank Page vs Lego Blocks</h1>\n<p>It is difficult and unnecessary to try to invent everything from scratch, just by staring at the blank page and trying to make something up by thinking really hard. I struggled with this a lot, it was one of the main causes of my writer's block.</p>\n<p>Instead of staring into the emptiness of a blank page, creativity should feel like playing with lego blocks. You take existing ideas and tropes you're already familiar with, and try to recombine them in new ways, or change them and turn them into something new.</p>\n<h3 id=\"picking-apart-stories\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#picking-apart-stories\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Picking Apart Stories</h3>\n<p>You obtain the lego blocks to play with by picking apart your favorite stories - movies, TV shows, books, games, comics, and so on.</p>\n<p>Look through the list of interesting stories, and extract the idea components out of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What did the main character want in this story, is there an interesting problem they were trying to solve?</li>\n<li>Does the story take place in an interesting setting?</li>\n<li>What are some of the coolest, most memorable characters that you've seen in this story?</li>\n<li>Does the story explore some interesting magics or technologies, does it involve some supernatural creatures?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not all stories will have all the four elements, but in most of them at least one of these components is really strong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve a murder despite memory loss (Memento)</li>\n<li>Diffuse the bomb before the bus stops moving (Speed)</li>\n<li>Defeat a skyscraper full of terrorists by yourself (Die Hard)</li>\n<li>Teach a young girl to kill so she could avenge her family (Leon)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Setting</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Hogwarts</li>\n<li>The Matrix</li>\n<li>Wasteland (Fallout)</li>\n<li>Jurassic Park</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Character</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Walter White</li>\n<li>Jack Sparrow</li>\n<li>Indiana Jones</li>\n<li>Ace Ventura</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Supernatural</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Time Loop (Groundhog Day)</li>\n<li>Sentient Toys (Toy Story)</li>\n<li>Body Switching (Freaky Friday)</li>\n<li>Mech Suit (Iron Man)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or a combination of these components is really interesting or unexpected:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared dreams + Heist = Inception</li>\n<li>Romeo and Juliet + RMS Titanic = Titanic</li>\n<li>Bank Heist + Zombies = Army of The Dead</li>\n<li>Time travel + Undo the Butterfly Effect = Back to the Future</li>\n<li>Sentient Animals + Avenge your Father = Lion King</li>\n<li>Time Travel + Robot Rebellion = Terminator</li>\n<li>Escape from Monster + Xenomorph = Alien</li>\n<li>Timid teacher + Become a Crime Lord = Breaking Bad</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Build a library of these elements. Many storytellers keep this library in their heads, but I recommend using <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgasFqcKVG0f0jOwBRaHYO6dYRSkgdx-UgtXXk3ictI/\">this google docs template</a> to create a digital library of ideas.</p>\n<p>Start collecting ideas. Whenever you see a movie/book/game that you enjoy, extract the ideas you liked the most, and add them to your collection.</p>\n<p>This library is like a big box of lego blocks - when it's time to create an adventure, you can use them to assemble a new and interesting combination of ideas that you haven't seen before.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, let's take a few elements from the lists above and recombine them into something new:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Romeo and Juliet + Bank Heist</strong><br>\nA love-struck teenager asks the players to help him commit a bank heist to impress the father of the girl he's in love with, a crime boss of a powerful mafia family.</li>\n<li><strong>Sentient Animals + Ace Ventura</strong><br>\nA crazy druid with the personality of Ace Ventura leads his army of sentient flying squirrels to take revenge on the lumberjack village that's destroying his forest.</li>\n<li><strong>Robot Rebellion + Hogwarts</strong><br>\nThe animated suits of armor and the stone gargoyles have been hijacked by unknown magic and are wrecking havoc on a magic castle. The players must rescue the royal family from the castle that came alive.</li>\n<li><strong>Titanic + Zombies</strong><br>\nA zombie outbreak on the ship leads to a catastrophe, players must survive on a sinking ship full of zombies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The trick is to realize that there's already an endless amount of creative ideas out there, made for you by thousands of storytellers, and these ideas are already good (since they're taken from the stories you like). You can just take the good ideas out of context, and make them different and unique by changing the genre, details, and combining them with other creative ideas in new ways. Then all you have to do is to assemble all these new ideas into a story that makes sense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adapting-stories\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#adapting-stories\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Adapting Stories</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to come up with an adventure idea is to just adapt one of your favorite stories, changing only a few details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alien in a Fantasy world</strong><br>\nStop the cruel power-hungry emperor who tries to build himself an army by breeding dangerous Xenomorph-like monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Die Hard in a Magic Castle</strong><br>\nVampires took over the magic school, you're the only ones who can rescue their hostages before they get turned into vampires.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Honey I Shrunk The Kids</strong><br>\nEvil witch poisons the players with a shrinking potion, they must escape and travel through her (now enormous) magic hut to the top shelf where the enlargement potion is stored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best way to make such adventures more original is to adapt ideas from different genres and mediums. If you're writing a fantasy adventure - adapt an idea from your favorite Sci-Fi TV show (like Rick and Morty or Firefly), from a game (like Last of Us), or a musical (like Nightmare Time by Starkid).</p>\n<h3 id=\"recombining-the-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#recombining-the-elements\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Recombining the Elements</h3>\n<p>Combine two interesting ideas together to create something new, mix and match the tropes, putting them together in different ways (like playing with lego blocks):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sentient Animals + Lord of the Rings</strong><br>\nPlayers play as mice who have stumbled upon The One Ring, and are now humanity's last hope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rescue Mission + Scary Monster</strong><br>\nThe players are hired by a cooky wizard to find and return his runaway pet. His pet is a zombie chimera made out of fury and rage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pirates + Floating Islands</strong><br>\nDefend a floating pirate town (think Tortuga) being attacked by a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice that the individual ideas don't have to be that interesting or original - you can just lift them from other stories, which is very easy to do. The unique combination of two simple ideas is what makes your story creative, unique, and original.</p>\n<h3 id=\"changing-the-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#changing-the-elements\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Changing the Elements</h3>\n<p>Another way to build on top of the ideas and make them more original is to change them in interesting ways.</p>\n<p>To change an idea, you need to take one of its key elements and reverse it (do the opposite), exaggerate it (take it to the extreme), or replace it with an entirely different element (idea from a completely different story or genre).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reverse the Goal: Rescue the Dragon from the Princess</strong><br>\nA cruel princess has kidnapped the baby dragon's mom, and is forcing her to fight in a coliseum. Help to rescue the big mama dragon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reverse the Key Character Trait: Evil Batman</strong><br>\nProtect the city from a ruthless high-tech vigilante driven by his misguided code of honor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Change the Setting: Typical Train Heist story, set on a Zeppelin</strong><br>\nRescue an innocent person being delivered by Zeppelin to serve her life sentence in prison.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exaggerate the Supernatural Element</strong><br>\nSolve the disappearance of cows in a village where <strong>everyone</strong> is secretly a werewolf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"combining-your-own-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#combining-your-own-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Combining Your Own Ideas</h2>\n<p>Make a list of 5-10 ideas using the methods above, and then combine/reverse/exaggerate some of <em>these</em> ideas to make something even more unique and interesting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zombies on the Titanic + Ace Ventura</strong><br>\nThe zombies have been released by a crazy zombie-rights activist who has steered the ship into the island where he's planning to build his own zombie utopia.</li>\n<li><strong>Runaway Chimera + Pirates of the Floating Island</strong><br>\nPlayers must protect the escaped gargoyle (a protected species) from the crew of flying pirates who are determined to capture it.</li>\n<li><strong>Shrinking Potion + The King's Feast</strong><br>\nKing's enemies have added the shrinking potion into wine, and now players must help the king to fight off the rebellion despite being the size of an ant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"using-images-and-adventure-prompts\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#using-images-and-adventure-prompts\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Using Images and Adventure Prompts</h2>\n<p>Just like extracting ideas from books and movies, you can extract them from artworks, which are a goldmine of useful ideas. <a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/\">ArtStation</a> has a lot of beautiful artworks, and the functionality that allows you to categorize them and build collections. You can install the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artstation-discover/ghkbedmkakkdhfkhchadmkhlflnafocm?hl=en\">extension</a> that randomly shows you a new artwork every time you open a new tab in the browser. Add the most inspiring images to your collection, and then use them as prompts to come up with ideas.</p>\n<p>I have already built a pretty big collection of cool ideas, and created a tool that recombines them for you automatically. Try using the <a href=\"https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts\">Adventure Prompts Tool</a> - generate random prompts and try to pitch a few ideas based on the combinations of these elements.</p>\n<p>I recommend setting a 2-minute timer, and challenging yourself to pitch a story idea based on whatever random prompts you end up with. These pitches often end up surprisingly interesting and creative, and in 20 minutes you can create 10 such pitches you can add to your list of ideas.</p>\n<p>It is much easier and more fun to do this together with a friend - take turns generating prompts and pitching ideas, then build on top of each other's ideas using the methods described above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-good-sources-of-story-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#more-good-sources-of-story-ideas\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>More Good Sources of Story Ideas</h2>\n<p>Aside from passively collecting ideas from the movies you're watching and the books you're reading, you can actively research ideas.

Once you know the Objective - everything else will fall into place, because almost all the other elements of the adventure are defined in relation to the Objective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adventure Hook</strong> is the moment at the beginning of the adventure where the players encounter the Problem they must solve or establish the Goal they will try to achieve.</li>\n<li><strong>Antagonist</strong> is the primary force that stands in the way of the players, their goal is the opposite of the heroes' Objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges and Encounters</strong> are the obstacles that the players will need to overcome on their path to the Objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Intriguing Mysteries</strong> are bits and pieces of information the players will gather throughout their adventure that are required for them to accomplish their goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Surprising Twist</strong> is the moment in the middle of the adventure when the players' Objective changes in some way - they realize that it's not what they once thought it was, or some complication makes it much more difficult to achieve.</li>\n<li><strong>The Climax</strong> of the adventure is the moment when the Objective is resolved, when the players succeed at accomplishing their goal (or, rarely, fail to do so and lose).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Resolving the Objective will be the single most important event in the story, it will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the \"final battle\" revolves around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stories-are-about-problem-solving\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#stories-are-about-problem-solving\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Stories are about Problem Solving</h2>\n<p>Stories and roleplaying games are fundamentally about creative problem-solving.</p>\n<p>Adventure Ideas are fundamentally problems. They create an exciting, challenging, important goal for the players to accomplish.</p>\n<p>This is the fundamental \"game loop\" of an RPG - the GM puts an interesting problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it.</p>\n<p>Big problems are broken down into smaller Challenges. In every scene the characters try to solve a small problem, their successes take them closer to achieving their goal, the setbacks and complications take them farther away from that goal.</p>\n<p>Players encounter a big problem at the beginning of the story, they go through a series of challenges that add up to ultimately solving the problem at the Climax of the story.</p>\n<p>This gives the players a sense of progress, makes them feel like their actions are meaningful, make an impact on the world, add up to some larger purpose. The Primary Objective is that purpose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-a-good-primary-objective\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#what-makes-a-good-primary-objective\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What makes a Good Primary Objective</h2>\n<p>The Primary Objective is a <strong>specific thing the players must do</strong> in order to succeed in their quest. A specific action they must take that will resolve the main conflict.</p>\n<p>Primary Objective must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Stakes</strong> - players should care about accomplishing it. It should be very meaningful and important to the characters and to the world they live in. Players should have a good reason to pursue it, whatever it takes.</li>\n<li><strong>Exciting</strong> - the problem should be interesting to solve, the goal should be desirable to achieve. Players will spend the whole adventure doing everything in their power to accomplish this, so it should be something fun to participate in.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult</strong> - the objective should be difficult to accomplish. It will be the main source of challenges and conflict in your story, it will create a lot of struggle for the characters, and you want your players to feel epic and heroic when they succeed.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Objective Examples</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Kill the dragon to save the village.</li>\n<li>Break out an innocent from an unassailable prison.</li>\n<li>Stop the Villain from opening a portal into the Demon Dimension.</li>\n<li>Solve the crime to prevent a war between the two kingdoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"objectives-and-villains\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#objectives-and-villains\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Objectives and Villains</h2>\n<p>Objectives come in two types, like two sides of the same coin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Players really want something, and the villain stands in their way.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Rescue a princess from a dragon.</li>\n<li>Journey to a distant location and find treasure.</li>\n<li>Broker peace between warring kingdoms.</li>\n<li>Perform the heist of the century.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Villain really wants something, and players must do whatever it takes to stop them.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent the villain from performing a terrible world-ending ritual.</li>\n<li>Make sure the villain won't get their hands on a powerful artifact.</li>\n<li>The Villain wants to kill or kidnap someone, and the players must protect them.</li>\n<li>The Villain is pursuing the players, and they must escape to survive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So any idea you have for an Objective is actually two ideas - it is either something the players want to pursue (\"Kill a Terrible Monster\"), or must prevent the villain from obtaining (\"Protect an Adorable Creature from the evil Hunter.\").</p>\n<p>Looking at the Objectives this way doubles the amount of ideas you have, and helps you to come up with interesting and unusual stories (by swapping the Heroes and the Villains, telling the story from the perspective of the Antagonist).</p>\n<h2 id=\"objective-archetypes\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#objective-archetypes\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Objective Archetypes</h2>\n<p>Just as described above, taking ideas from your favorite stories (and changing them a bit) is one of the best ways to come up with your objective.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other story elements, the objectives actually tend to be pretty generic - there's a limited amount of story archetypes (the goals the heroes can pursue). There are about 10-20 most common objectives that 90% of the stories revolve around. What makes an objective unique is the specifics of the story, all the other elements of the adventure idea that surround the objective.</p>\n<p>When you watch movies and read stories, learn to notice the objective the heroes are trying to pursue, and compile a list of your favorite ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are some of the most common objectives:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining some important item (McGuffin), creature, person, or information.<br>\n(Train robberies, fetch quests, rescue missions, spy missions, capturing fugitives.)</li>\n<li>Killing/defeating a Villain or a dangerous monster who's up to no good.<br>\n(Horror movies, superhero movies, many sci-fi and fantasy movies.)</li>\n<li>Traveling to some distant location through dangerous territory, or ending up in a dangerous place and trying to survive and return home.<br>\n(Most adventure stories).</li>\n<li>Solving mysteries, finding out the truth.<br>\n(Most detective and mystery stories).</li>\n<li>Invading, Defending, or Escaping a location.<br>\n(Heists, prison breaks, many action movies).</li>\n<li>Convincing/manipulating people, gaining power through non-violent means.<br>\n(Intrigue, drama).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(or preventing a villain from doing one of the above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/files/objective-archetypes.pdf\">Here</a> you can see the full list of the objectives I have compiled.

To do that, you can use the <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template\">brainstorming template</a> - it will guide you through the process of turning your idea into a story.</p>\n<p>I also wrote an adventure writing course, which is available for free <a href=\"https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy\">here</a>.

Here's how it works:\n\n- Picture yourself running the adventure.

This is optional, and goes between Sentences 3 and 4. It's used to impart a feeling onto the players, like something they'd be able to infer from their surroundings.\n\n\"You get an eerie sense of loneliness\" \"Whatever this place was, it must have been important\" \"You feel like you're on hallowed ground\"\n\n**Improv Homework**. It's a lot easier to improv if you have a set structure. You assignment is to practice describing scenes when you're out of game. Describe things on the street, in the coffee shop, at school. Go to somewhere more out of the way like a park, river, forest, etc. Good luck and have fun with these!\n\n-->","html":"<p>Are you struggling to describe settings and locations in your games?

It is focused on exploring a single comedic idea (called \"The Game\") - one unusual thing that heightens to comedic absurdity.\n\n## What is The Game?\nThe game is a consistent pattern of unusual behavior that breaks from the expected patterns of our everyday lives. If you watch a comedy sketch, and summarize what’s funny about it in one sentence - that is its game.\n  \n#### Some examples of games:\n-   [Philosophical Truth or Dare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_KaLmNMYY) - Girls are playing a Truth or Dare game, where the “Truth” means big, philosophical truth, like “are humans inherently good?”\n-   [Dead Parrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo) - Man tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store.\n-   [Boarding a Plane Shouldn’t Be This Hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhxlZC8BZJ4) - A passenger in “Boarding Group 1” gets frustrated when he must wait as more and more unexpected groups get to board the plane before he can.\n-   [The Audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CIgWX1J_s8) - A pair of casting agents are continually confused by an actor’s monologue that is indistinguishable from the act of auditioning itself.\n\nEach of these bullet points describes something unusual that repeatedly affects our characters. Even if you’ve never seen these sketches, you can read these sentences and understand what’s funny about the sketch. Every moment of the sketch supports this same repeating idea.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to make your life easier by forcing you to focus on a single comic idea - you don’t have to come up with new funny things to add to the scene, you only need to heighten and explore what’s already there. As you’re playing the Game, make sure to avoid introducing new absurd elements unrelated to the one created by the First Unusual Thing.\n\n\n## Base Reality\nThe first step to creating a comedy sketch is to establish the \"Base Reality\" of your scene - the “Who, What, and Where”, a believable, somewhat realistic situation that isn’t trying to be funny, it is the normal ordinary world you create so that anything funny or unusual can clearly stand out in contrast to it.\n\nThe way jokes have a setup and a punchline, sketches have “base reality” (an ordinary world we establish at the beginning), and “the game” (which, just like a punchline, breaks the pattern of the ordinary reality we have established).\n  \n## Finding the First Unusual Thing\nOnce the base reality is established, you need to find and play the Game. The key to finding and playing the Game is identifying the First Unusual Thing in a scene - some behavior or a piece of information that breaks from the pattern of normal life, something out of the ordinary in the context of Base Reality. This is the absurd element in your scene, and The Game will be focused on heightening and exploring this absurdity.\n\nOften, the First Unusual Thing comes up organically, but you can also create it deliberately - by exaggerating some aspect of the scene, or doing the opposite of what’s expected, or adding some absurd element to the environment or the character.\n\n## Heightening and Exploring\nOnce the First Unusual Thing has been found, we no longer need to develop the Base Reality, we can shift to playing the Game and being funny. To play the game, we do two things: Heightening and Exploring.\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-18.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\n  \n\n### 1. Heightening\nWe build on the absurd aspect introduced by the First Unusual Thing by using heightening and exaggeration. Heightening is “the act of making a Game move that is more absurd than anything that has preceded it”, each heightened game move deviates even further from the expected pattern of reality.\n  \nTo do that, ask yourself “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?”. Repeatedly answering this question creates a comedic pattern.\n\n  \n\n### 2. Exploring\nThe other key component for playing the game is exploration - justifying your game moves with logical rationale, explaining why your character (or your scene partner) is making absurd choices, providing reasonable explanations for the absurdity. That grounds the scene in reality, making the absurd believable, making it make sense.\n\n> #### Player 1  \n> So… my big news is… I am in love with a dolphin.\n> #### Player 2   \n> Well, dolphins are smarter than most people, and have superior hearing. I can see how she would be able to understand you more than any human you’ve ever dated.\n\nYou justify the absurdity by answering “If this absurd thing is true, then why is it true?”, and trying to find answers that make sense. These logical answers, juxtaposed with the absurd behavior, make the scene even funnier.\n\n  \n\n## Sketch Structure\nSo, your sketch should have an unusual pattern (the game). Every time we revisit the unusual thing, it should get more exaggerated (heightening), and every moment in between should add more logically consistent details (exploring).\n  \n-   Start the sketch by establishing the base reality.\n-   Introduce The First Unusual Thing.\n-   Heighten+Explore it 3 times, making it increasingly absurd.\n-   End the sketch once you have heightened the game as much as possible, and made it as absurd as it can be.\n    \n\n  \n\n## Read More\n[The Basics #1: What Is A Sketch and How Does It Work?](https://chuffah.substack.com/p/the-basics-1-sketch-and-game)\n\n[The Basics #2: Surprising Truth](https://chuffah.substack.com/p/the-basics-2-surprising-truth)\n\n[The Basics #3: Where Do You Get Your Ideas?](https://chuffah.substack.com/p/where-do-you-get-your-ideas)\n\n[The Basics #4: Brainstorming and outlining](https://chuffah.substack.com/p/brainstorms-and-outlines)\n\n[The Basics #5: Turning a Blank Page into a Rough Draft](https://chuffah.substack.com/p/a-rough-draft-of-a-brand-new-sketch)\n\n[Dissecting \"Philosophical Truth or Dare\" (excellent sketch example)](https://chuffah.substack.com/p/dissecting-philosophical-truth-or)\n\n[What Makes Improv Funny?](https://improvisationalcomedy.com/what-makes-improv-funny/)\n\n[UCB – The Game](https://funnyshmunny.wordpress.com/ucb-the-game/)\n\n[A quick guide to Game of the Scene](https://www.hooplaimpro.com/quick-guide-game-of-scene)\n\n[UCB Manual](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Upright-Citizens-Brigade-Comedy-Improvisation/dp/0989387801) ([audio version](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Upright-Citizens-Brigade-Comedy-Improv-Manual-Audiobook/1980063559?qid=1663574305&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=PBSG4JD7TYQ5CR54XA9Y)) - the ultimate, book-length explanation of improv comedy that delves deep into what “The Game” is, how to find and play it.\n\n[Step by Step to Stand-up Comedy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Step-Stand-up-Comedy-Greg-Dean/dp/0325001790) ([audio version](https://www.audible.com/pd/Step-by-Step-to-Stand-Up-Comedy-Audiobook/B07BRZ6P8Z?qid=1663574384&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=C6Q09BZ0RB8GN8XM9QK2)) - an excellent book about joke writing.\n","html":"<p>This is a short summary of the theory you need to know about writing (or improvising) comedy sketches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-comedy-sketches\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#what-are-comedy-sketches\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What are comedy sketches?</h2>\n<p>A sketch is a short, self-contained, funny scene.

Setup leads people to recognize a pattern, which their brains automatically use to make predictions and assumptions. Punch line forces their brain to switch to a different pattern, shattering their assumptions, making it clear that predictions they've made are invalid.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dZy1LIWzdyc7fLd9HLPVMD6C4vMSIXYOMvD3gLmTWt-V5n0WAcE_RNWjOMGO1CI38_hI3X8bNXcOAhy_d-a5ONoIMgADq_BHaIhpjMKgQKmWx29QuEuTdn1KQRBB4LHQyy3ZgRODXAcTAwRzKDCJeWE)\n\nThe two patterns must be connected by one thing they have in common - “Connector”.  Connector is one thing with two interpretations that belong to two wildly unrelated patterns.\n\nFor example:\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VAsHm9bzAgHBqzpuOLXq8PD5k8RIcvkT1e5sjc07Rd6I4AXKTsfOO7PsZ4ySGlCGzINjTcYosItduzF2KdIjLTnFJ4zq0vQQN-w-UpL8Rdpk8kUzKv1LP9M4JhoLbnLja0jOlqZskcv2zJInh0oh5EQ\" className=\"small\" />\n\n<br/>\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JYZKECyuDsMLhwh-IMt-I9cKn7RnPKU0bDKT_Ejs3QAsf5--fvVBfUIMAB2PAQVob7q30zGnidjrZqpgQLsh6JjpGJUJkngM-SkXXxFQYcVg63gaXr0HYYYBXEpayMGUy2cSTWrNYu0KHjKGbrkOWBs\" className=\"small\" />\n\n-   The setup (“My grandfather had the heart of a lion”) makes us recognize the first pattern: Brave grandfather.\n-   The punchline (“and a lifetime ban from the Central Park Zoo”) makes us switch to the second pattern: Grandfather holding an actual heart of a lion.\n-   The “Heart of a lion” is the connector, one thing that has two wildly different interpretations, one element that belongs to two entirely unrelated patterns.\n\nThe connector, or the patterns, don’t have to be made out of words, they can be abstract concepts, or even visual appearance:\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rAxhacdD7ysr497N3XFYYa6QGmI_FOsgkjBz6ugJTu2elcf0desVscICVyZrXfM1lb0GdNUwQdZYiblbdYMaVK6fn9ZALC0dV9oemcjzqTCDAO9e4hMxorYZyHiR3mCA3qzrlMICz-Hc52inyMGw_3I)\n\nThe idea here is the same, one thing with two interpretations belonging to two different patterns:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/656/1*9pjTiMrL8717WIsn8rR4aw.png)\n\n### Absurd Associations\n\nAt the core of any joke is an \"absurd association\", an unexpected connection between two ideas, two patterns that don’t belong together, but have one thing in common - the connector, the one thing with two interpretations.\n\nTo write a joke, we need to find two patterns that are connected by one thing. Then we can write a setup - a statement that leads people to recognize the first pattern, and a punch line - a statement that makes them switch to the second pattern.\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yu9gRGOc1GjjVw2mZJ9M5OtF8e2GZqcwZOlQYK1W-jLGD9EN9RS0OxtsMJg-pEQ9wTv6WLydYTqcOsJvWMVDIEc1U1olInxqNrtu0BKhrCqUQKjZJJ3VL4aLNEJ3grQT2JS963UwAAbA32EkZ93Ihrg\" className=\"small\" />\n\n\nThe less two patterns belong together (the “farther” they are from each other, the more absurd their juxtaposition is), the funnier the joke will be. The better the two patterns are connected (the more Connector makes sense in the context of each of the patterns), the “smarter” the joke will be, the more sense it will make.\n\nSo the trick to writing jokes is finding absurd associations, interesting connections between patterns that aren’t normally connected. “Cat” - “Paws” - “Dog” is a valid association, but it’s not funny or interesting, it’s too obvious. “Cat” - “Nine Lives” - “Video Games” is much better, because we don’t normally associate cats with video games.\n\n### Pattern Recognizers\n\nSo we need to be able to find absurd associations.

The theory is incomplete, but I had quite a few epiphanies that I think many people may find interesting and useful.\n\n# Background — how mind works\n\nThe purpose of the brain is to make predictions. (When you can make good predictions about the world — you are better at survival and reproduction.)\n\nBrain does this by recognizing and learning patterns. When you see the same pattern multiple times, you can recognize it, memorize it, and when you see it(or something similar) the next time — you know what to expect, so you can make predictions.\n\nFor example:\n\n> What is the last word at the end of this ______?\n\nThe word “sentence” naturally leaps to mind, because you have recognized a familiar pattern.\n\nBy recognizing patterns, brain can take the input, and then _make predictions_ and _fill in missing information_.\n\nFor example:\n\n> A B _ D _\n\nYou can easily fill in the missing information. Here’s how it works.\n\nYour brain receives some **input**:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/218/1*hiN9XhrnfG4qI0C6qD6q0A.png)\n\nThen it **recognizes an abstract pattern**(interprets the input)**:**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/582/1*_YGpzdp2IphafFwWnN-zTw.png)\n\nThen it can use the abstract pattern it recognized to:\n\n-   Make _assumptions and explanations_ of what is going on(fill in the gaps).\n-   Make _predictions and expectations_ about what is going to happen.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/584/1*DXkc5GvFptA0ZoMamMM1hA.png)\n\nBrain does the same thing with any sound/image/situation that you experience:\n\n![](/post/comedy-theory/cat.png)\n\nOf course this is a simplified model, and each node here represents a whole network of neurons who’s job is to fire when it receives some pattern as an input. You may have heard about Artificial Neural Networks that are used in the famous Deep Learning algorithms, that is what this model is inspired by.\n\nBrain has a whole hierarchy of patterns, that feed into each other:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6nfnuUrahmuAYUT53Qanaw.png)\n\nSometimes input is ambiguous, and has several interpretations:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/766/1*zbtHNSTkeGWV13qMm09ing.png)\n\nThat happens because some **neurons are shared between multiple networks**, and can represent different things. For example the same neurons are responsible for recognizing a vertical line |, but with some additional information can be recognized as different letters:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/572/1*FFfMRCGykvhQYcF8wubnSg.png)\n\nSome inputs have a common, normal, **default interpretation**, but can be **reinterperted** in different ways:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/656/1*9pjTiMrL8717WIsn8rR4aw.png)\n\n# Comedy\n\nComedy happens when **brain realizes that it recognized the wrong pattern**, that _predictions/expectations/explanations/assumptions_ that it made about a situation are (**very**)**wrong**, so it’s current interpretation of the input is destroyed, and it **switches** to a different(often unexpected and “crazy”) interpretation.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/594/1*Pfp6_wU07hNIXlURkJUXGg.png)\n\nIn practice I imagine it looking more like this:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/890/1*wyPM-8rJT2HRdSBBFNlNxQ.png)\n\nSo that a whole bunch of concepts, associations, recognized concepts gets “turned off” and switched to a completely different one.\n\n_(To keep it simple, I’m representing a whole complicated bunch of nodes that represent even more complicated bunch of neurons with just one circle)_\n\n# Joke Structure\n\nJoke consists of 2 parts: **setup** and **punchline**.\n\nWhen you hear a **Setup** of a joke, it leads your brain to recognize a pattern, and make predictions/assumptions/expectations based on that.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/752/1*WrCbOrOw0DYqwZCYpU1Q_g.png)\n\nSetup has 2 possible interpretations, but strongly suggests the default one.\n\nThe goal of setup is to establish a pattern, to (mis)lead a person to go down a normal, default lane of thinking.\n\nAnd then **punch** line **reveals some new information**, which makes you realize that your initial recognition was _very_ wrong, that shatters assumptions/predictions that your brain has made, brain rapidly switches to a new lane of thinking(to a different pattern), and that’s when you laugh.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/752/1*_DJcFfDxXHiwjqEXQDigBg.png)\n\nNotice the element that is connected to both default and alternative interpretation. It represents the **shared neurons** between the 2 networks, the neurons that are responsible for recognizing either of them. It is called “**connector**”.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/752/1*lFpXGl2xZObwSDYhoIB8hw.png)\n\nConnector is compatible with both of the interpretations, it belongs to both lanes of thinking.\n\nFor example:\n\n> Doctor’s appointment.  \n> The doctor says “You’re gonna have to stop masturbating.”  \n> The patient says “But why!?”  \n> The doctor says “So I can examine you.”\n\nThe first 3 lines are the _setup_, they lead you to recognize a usual pattern, brain fills in the blanks, makes assumptions, and you imagine a usual doctor’s appointment, where the patient receives some bad news.\n\nThe last line is punch, which reveals new information, and forces your brain to reinterpret the setup, and imagine a completely different scenario. You realize that your default interpretation of the input was _very_ wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that’s when you laugh.\n\nNotice that the setup is compatible with both interpretations, yet strongly suggests the “normal” one.\n\n(In this case the whole setup is a connector, but to create a joke, it is _not_ always necessary to reinterpret the whole setup, sometimes connector can be only a part of it.)\n\n# Writing a joke\n\nWhen we come up with a joke, the first thing we see is a connector with 2 interpretations:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/604/1*-uPSr_fogSEgYvUH--8XVg.png)\n\nAnother way to think about connector is that it is an **absurd association between 2 patterns**. It can be some common element or a common word that fits 2 very different patterns.\n\nFor example, one of my favorite jokes:\n\n> A family walks into a hotel, the father comes up to the front desk and says:  \n> “I hope the porn is disabled.”  \n> The guy at the desk replies:  \n> “It’s just regular porn you sick fuck.”\n\nA person who made this joke, first found a connection/association:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/604/1*QU5P4o49OFuRqD10g36eRA.png)\n\nThen, he wrote a setup, that is compatible with both interpretations, but strongly suggests the first one, leading your brain to recognize the first pattern:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/606/1*-ZKfs5XnnbIPDCbsk3_ROw.png)\n\nThen he wrote a punch line, that forces your brain to switch the interpretation:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/606/1*B_67oeALEzNudzW5S6yqtA.png)\n\n# Search for associations\n\nFinding the connector that can express 2 very different patterns(be interpreted in 2 ways) is the main challenge of comedy. **The process of writing comedy is the process of searching for associations, for 2 connected patterns**.\n\nYou can do that in two ways:\n\n-   Find an element that lies on the intersection of 2 abstract patterns.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/692/1*8neqfZL9ibwB2g4OsiAODg.png)\n\n-   Find an alternative interpretation of the the element:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/766/1*LGtPl5P7jmtcudUHDbtUwA.png)\n\nHere I want to demonstrate a simple and straightforward process for doing that(I use the 2nd way, because it’s easier to explain).\n\n## 1. Scene\n\nTo begin our search we need some place to start. You can start with a random topic, but for practical purposes it can be more convenient to start with a **scene** — a **character in a situation**.\n\nThis is concrete, easy to imagine, and gives us a lot of elements to work with.\n\nLet’s say we start with a simple random scene:\n\n> Two people playing the game of Go.\n\n## 2. Elements\n\nThe first thing we need to begin our search for connections is to break down the scene into **elements**.\n\nSome examples of elements are:\n\n-   Each separate word that describes the situation\n-   Physical things you imagine when you read a scene — objects, characters, environment\n-   Adjectives you would use to describe the scene and things in it.\n-   Expectations — what do you think will happen next\n-   Assumptions — why does this happen, what is going on here?\n-   Opinion — what is your opinion about it, what does it make you think about.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/820/1*xvYhFV7NX0okK7dyHBjk4g.png)\n\nIn our case that could be:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/820/1*D6422dJmE5MIR_X1juP2Ig.png)\n\n## 4. Drop Context, extract element.\n\nWe need associations not related to our scene(and the less related they are — the better).\n\nSo the next thing we do is **select an element**, and **drop context** — that is, we pick one of the elements from the previous scene, forget about the scene, and look at it separately, on it’s own.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/818/1*NCGn1lhnWbm0WQCB-3Xt6g.png)\n\nLet’s say this:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/818/1*10R1OQMP0NJ1SfMN9DpGkw.png)\n\n## 5. Look for associations.\n\nThe next step is to search for associations, find other patterns that this element belongs to(unrelated to our original scene):\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1160/1*bUvArr3YnRcvXqSmzfAfgg.png)\n\nIn our case, for example this could be:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/904/1*hWfdG3Q88ySZ5Ljtn_nDwQ.png)\n\n## 6. Write Setup and Punch\n\nFinally, we have 2 separate, unrelated ideas connected by one element.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/604/1*kzRNZ18cBNCosxUOGvVCHg.png)\n\nNow we can write a setup, the challenge here is to pick words that can express either interpretation, but leads your brain to think about the first one.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/606/1*ZyqPwTTg7opo7rT_JIowbA.png)\n\nAfter that, all we need is to use the punch line to express the second interpretation, and make the switch to a second pattern:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/606/1*dnBigmG3tL-9EJPx7Zcchg.png)\n\nAs a result we have a joke:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bxGo3Q3AtQsO4Cvfsjwyig.png)\n\nHere’s a couple more examples I’ve made from the scene above:\n\n> **Element:** Will use clever tactics to defeat his opponent.  \n> **Association(Connector):** Clever tactics — Evil Machiavellian Plotting  \n> **Setup:** I’ve heard they used the game of Go to train emperors in war strategy. In go the person with smartest tactics wins.  \n> **Punch:** In my opinion, the best tactic for winning Go is to frame your opponent for murder and have him executed before the game begins.\n> \n> **Element:** Play by placing stones on the board.  \n> **Association(Connector):** Stones — Testicles  \n> **Setup:**  \n> - I got thrown out of the Go club last Friday.  \n> - What happened?  \n> - They taught me that you play by placing stones on the board, and the player who has the best shape wins.  \n> **Punch:**  \n> - So?  \n> - I placed the wrong kind of stones.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis framework explains the vast majority of jokes I encounter. I think it is significant, because comedy used to be a “black box” that, people claim, “can not be understood”. But now I can look at any joke, identify it’s structure, and see how all it’s parts fit together, and this allows me to reverse-engineer the thinking process of a person who made the joke.\n\nMore importantly, unlike other comedy theories, this allows me to create a process with which **I can consistently generate jokes by following simple, straightforward steps**. In my experience, this process works pretty well. Not all jokes made with it end up being hilarious, but they all are unmistakably jokes. And by spending enough time on search I successfully come up with some solid ideas.\n\nIn my future articles I will explain a second, more advanced process of generating jokes, provide more examples, and use this framework to explain other types of comedy(visual jokes, etc).\n\n# Disclaimers and questions\n\nThis article is my first attempt to express my ideas. I’m not a neuroscientist, and I’m sure everything is much more complicated, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.\n\nI am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I’m looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.\n\nPlease let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!\n\n<!-- My email is raymestalez@gmail.com, and I’m happy to discuss the subject.\n-->\n\n## Questions:\n\n-   Why are there so many jokes about “taboo” subjects? It’s clearly not a _necessary_ requirement for a good joke, yet it helps(?). Are these jokes funnier? Or easier to make? Why?\n-   What if comedy is not about “switching” from one interpretation to another, but about finding an unexpected connection between two abstract patterns? When I come up with a joke, I tend to laugh after finding the connector, though expressing it with well-worded setup-punch helps.\n-   Some jokes connect patterns that are more than one association “away” from each other. For example a joke about school shootings: “The children went to school to get books and all they got were magazines.”  \n    Here the chain of associations is  \n    “[School] books — magazines — [weapon]magazines.”  \n    I want to better understand how it works and how to make those(jokes, not shootings).\n-   More unexpected, “crazy” jokes, jokes challenging more fundamental assumptions, jokes connected by longer chain of associations, and jokes where 2 interpretations connected together “stronger”(fit with connector better) seem to be funnier. Why? Does this explain why “taboo” jokes are funnier? Could the size of the network of concepts that is being switched just be larger?\n-   Are there better/simple/faster, more elegant ways to write jokes? What are the other ways? What jokes can not be explained(and written) with the system I have presented? What are some counterexamples that don’t “fit” the framework?\n-   People who make jokes “naturally”(without the process) seem to be doing it with some quick mental operation, in one step. Is it a matter of practice? What is the best way to practice writing jokes like that? What is a way to “deformalize” this process — keep all the understanding and control, yet do it easier/faster?\n-   What about babies laughing at “peekaboo”? What about tickling? What about girls giggling when talking about “dirty” subjects and other forms of “social” laughter? These are not explained by my framework, and I really want to know how are they connected to “comedy” jokes.\n\n# Resources\n\nA lot of these ideas are inspired by these wonderful books:\n\n-   “On Intelligence” by Jeff Hawkins\n-   “Step by Step to Stand-up Comedy” by Greg Dean\n-   “Serious Creativity” by Edward De Bono","html":"<p>I am working on a theory that would explain how comedy works, and turn the process of writing jokes into an understandable, structured process that anyone can learn.

I think it is significant, because comedy used to be a “black box” that, people claim, “can not be understood”. But now I can look at any joke, identify it’s structure, and see how all it’s parts fit together, and this allows me to reverse-engineer the thinking process of a person who made the joke.</p>\n<p>More importantly, unlike other comedy theories, this allows me to create a process with which <strong>I can consistently generate jokes by following simple, straightforward steps</strong>. In my experience, this process works pretty well. Not all jokes made with it end up being hilarious, but they all are unmistakably jokes. And by spending enough time on search I successfully come up with some solid ideas.</p>\n<p>In my future articles I will explain a second, more advanced process of generating jokes, provide more examples, and use this framework to explain other types of comedy(visual jokes, etc).</p>\n<h1 id=\"disclaimers-and-questions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#disclaimers-and-questions\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Disclaimers and questions</h1>\n<p>This article is my first attempt to express my ideas. I’m not a neuroscientist, and I’m sure everything is much more complicated, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.</p>\n<p>I am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I’m looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.</p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!</p>\n<h2 id=\"questions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#questions\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Questions:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Why are there so many jokes about “taboo” subjects? It’s clearly not a <em>necessary</em> requirement for a good joke, yet it helps(?). Are these jokes funnier? Or easier to make? Why?</li>\n<li>What if comedy is not about “switching” from one interpretation to another, but about finding an unexpected connection between two abstract patterns? When I come up with a joke, I tend to laugh after finding the connector, though expressing it with well-worded setup-punch helps.</li>\n<li>Some jokes connect patterns that are more than one association “away” from each other. For example a joke about school shootings: “The children went to school to get books and all they got were magazines.”<br>\nHere the chain of associations is<br>\n“[School] books — magazines — [weapon]magazines.”<br>\nI want to better understand how it works and how to make those(jokes, not shootings).</li>\n<li>More unexpected, “crazy” jokes, jokes challenging more fundamental assumptions, jokes connected by longer chain of associations, and jokes where 2 interpretations connected together “stronger”(fit with connector better) seem to be funnier. Why? Does this explain why “taboo” jokes are funnier? Could the size of the network of concepts that is being switched just be larger?</li>\n<li>Are there better/simple/faster, more elegant ways to write jokes? What are the other ways? What jokes can not be explained(and written) with the system I have presented? What are some counterexamples that don’t “fit” the framework?</li>\n<li>People who make jokes “naturally”(without the process) seem to be doing it with some quick mental operation, in one step. Is it a matter of practice? What is the best way to practice writing jokes like that? What is a way to “deformalize” this process — keep all the understanding and control, yet do it easier/faster?</li>\n<li>What about babies laughing at “peekaboo”? What about tickling? What about girls giggling when talking about “dirty” subjects and other forms of “social” laughter? These are not explained by my framework, and I really want to know how are they connected to “comedy” jokes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#resources\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Resources</h1>\n<p>A lot of these ideas are inspired by these wonderful books:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“On Intelligence” by Jeff Hawkins</li>\n<li>“Step by Step to Stand-up Comedy” by Greg Dean</li>\n<li>“Serious Creativity” by Edward De Bono</li>\n</ul>","body":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    h1: \"h1\",\n    blockquote: \"blockquote\",\n    em: \"em\",\n    strong: \"strong\",\n    img: \"img\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    br: \"br\",\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"I am working on a theory that would explain how comedy works, and turn the process of writing jokes into an understandable, structured process that anyone can learn.

Punchline forces their brain to switch to a different pattern, shattering their assumptions, making it clear that predictions they've made are invalid.\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-02.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nFor example:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-03.png\" className=\"small1\" />\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-04.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\n-   The setup (“My grandfather had the heart of a lion”) makes us recognize the first pattern: Brave grandfather.\n-   The punchline (“and a lifetime ban from the Central Park Zoo”) makes us switch to the second pattern: Grandfather holding an actual heart of a lion.\n-   The “Heart of a lion” is the common aspect, one thing that has two wildly different interpretations, one element that belongs to two entirely unrelated patterns.\n    \n\nThe two patterns must be connected by one thing they have in common - “Common Aspect”.  The Common Aspect is one thing with two interpretations that belong to two wildly unrelated patterns.\n\nThe common aspect is often a word in the setup that has two different interpretations:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-05.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be based on words. You can reinterpret any aspect of the pattern evoked by the setup:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-07.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nIn this case, the word \"Holiday\" isn't present in the setup, but it is an aspect of a pattern that our brain recognizes when it hears the setup.\n\nThis isn’t limited to wordplay based jokes, the common aspect and the patterns can be abstract ideas, or even images:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-08.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-09.png\" className=\"small1\" />\n\n  \n\n## Absurd Associations\n\nAt the core of any joke is an \"absurd association\", an unexpected connection between two ideas, two patterns that don’t belong together, but have one thing in common - the common aspect, the one thing with two interpretations. It's like rhyming ideas.\n\nTo write a joke, we need to find two patterns that are connected by one thing. Then we can write a setup - a statement that leads people to recognize the first pattern, and a punch line - a statement that makes them switch to the second pattern.\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-10.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nThe less two patterns belong together (the “farther” they are from each other, the more absurd their juxtaposition is), the funnier the joke will be. The better the two patterns are connected (the more Common Aspect makes sense in the context of each of the patterns), the “smarter” the joke will be, the more sense it will make.\n\nWhen we’re looking for absurd associations, we want both of the patterns to be closely connected to the one thing they have in common, but be as different from each other as possible:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-11.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nFor example, “Cat” - “Paws” - “Dog” is a valid association, but it’s not funny or interesting, it’s too obvious. “Cat” - “Nine Lives” - “Video Games” is much better, because we don’t normally associate cats with video games.\n\n  \n\n## Aspects\n\nSo we need to be able to find absurd associations, surprising connections between unrelated ideas. To do that, we need to understand aspects.\n\n  \n\nAll patterns are made out of smaller patterns, and are a part of bigger patterns.\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-12.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nAny pattern is made out of many smaller patterns, and is a part of many bigger patterns:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-13.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nTo find interesting associations, we need to take an aspect out of context, look at it separately from the pattern, and then find a different pattern this aspect belongs to:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-14.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nFor example, with the cat:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-15.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nOur topic is “Cat”. We list aspects, and take one out of context “Nine Lives”. Then we’re looking for other patterns the “Nine Lives” aspect belongs to, that are entirely unrelated to the original “Cat” topic, and we find “Video Games”.\n\nSo “Nine Lives” is the one thing with multiple interpretations we were looking for.\n\nIn our workshop we have an exercise that shows you how to break down a pattern into multiple aspects in more detail, and  gives you a few examples:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/aspects-examples.png\" className=\"small\" />\n  \n\n## Mixing Patterns\n\nOnce we have an absurd association, a surprising connection between the two patterns, the only thing left is to combine these patterns together.\n\n  \n\nWe do that by taking an aspect of one pattern, and applying it to the other pattern:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-16.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\nLike so:\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/post/comedy-theory/comedy-theory-17.png\" className=\"small\" />\n\n## Joke Examples\nAnd here are a few jokes that were created using this method:\n\n![](/post/comedy-theory/joke-examples.png)\n\n## Expressing Funny Ideas\nOnce you found a funny idea, it can be expressed in multiple different formats - as a stand up style one-liner joke, a dialogue exchange, a webcomic, an improv scene, a comedy sketch. \n\nFor example, a joke about the wild cakes from before:\n> I'm not supposed to be able to make you a cake, I'm a man! I'd do it only if I could go into the wild, hunt down, and slaughter a herd of wild cakes.\n\nCan also be expressed as a [comedy sketch](/post/comedy-theory/wild-cakes.pdf).\n\n\n## How to write Comedy Sketches\nRead the post on writing comedy sketches [here](https://rpgadventures.io/post/comedy-sketches).\n\n## Contact me\nDo you have any feedback on these ideas? Questions, or ways to improve them?\n\nSend an email to `lumenwrites@gmail.com`, or connect with me on Discord - `lumen#7925` .\n\n## Join our community\n Join our [discord community](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D) to participate in our comedy writing, improv, and roleplaying workshops.\n\n---\n\nEverything below is a work in progress (I need better explanations and examples to express these ideas clearly, but I figured I'll share the notes I have anyway).\n\n## Comedy is search\nComedy is search, you're searching through a network of ideas, trying to find find an unexpected connection between wildly different patterns.\n\nAs you search, not all of your attempts will pay off, there are many instances where there just isn't an interesting connection between patterns. That's okay, it simply takes time to run through a few dozen ideas until you find an interesting one.\n\n## Advanced methods of finding jokes\nTaking an aspect out of context, and finding a second pattern it belongs to is the most straightforward way fo finding those connections.\n\nBut there are other options. \n\n### Association Chains\nYou can take two random, unconnected patterns, and try to find a common aspect between them.\n\nFor example, take two random topics \"Athletes\" and \"Trains\". List the aspects of each of these topics, and see if you can find a way to connect them, find something they have in common.\n\n> Athletes are training (sounds like a train), trains can run on time (athletes run).\n\nSo we end up in the same situation - absurd association between unrelated patterns. And from this, we can write a joke, like:\n\n> Two guys walk out of a gym.\n> Guy 1: Oh, man, I feel like I've been ran over by a train.\n> Guy 2: I guess that's why they call it training.\n\n### Absurdify and Justify\nAnother way of finding interesting connections is to take one of the aspects, and make it absurd - reverse it, exaggerate it, or replace it with with something unexpected, something that doesn't belong with the pattern.\n\nOnce you have an absurd version of the aspect, find a second pattern where this absurd version fits and makes sense.\n\n## Pure Absurd Jokes\nThere's a category of jokes I didn't mention before that I call \"Pure Absurd\" jokes, which have no \"Common Aspect\" - just two patterns that don't belong together smashed together, with no clear association between them. Sometimes doing the stupidest thing that makes the least sense possible is just funny, there's no more structure to it.\n\nSome examples: [The Pimparoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrvT1CYZLwg), [Iraq Lobster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f31mB6apCoE), [Hitler Juggling Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsXc_I0lxcI0).\n\n## Improving Jokes\nThe farther apart two patterns are from each other, the more different they are, the less they belong together, the more contrast there is between them - the funnier the joke will be.\n\nThe more patterns have in common, the closer they are associated to the common asepct, the more connections they have between them - the \"smarter\" the joke will be. Strongly connected jokes make more sense, they're more interesting.\n\nSo two main ways of improving jokes are:\n- Heightening the contrast between the two patterns. You can do that by exaggerating one of them even more wildly, picking patterns that are farther away from each other. Or you can swap the aspects that are more absurd and specific, taking an aspect of one pattern that belongs with the second pattern as little as possible.\n- Making stronger connections between the patterns by searching for more aspects they have in common. Explain and justify the connection between patterns in a way that makes more sense.\n\nThe simplest way to connect two patterns is by finding words that have multiple meanings, and connecting the two different interpretations of the word. But you can also search for more abstract and unexpected connections, look for aspects that are less obvious. \n\nSome jokes have multiple punch lines (called \"tags\"). To create a tag you need to swap more than one aspect, come up with more examples of applying one pattern to another.\n\n{/* \nMake it more concise. Clarity and brevity.\nEnd on the word that triggers a laugh.\nCallbacks.
