Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment.\n\nIt's really fun, it works, and it really helps with creating adventures! Usually, by the end of the brainstorming session, we have a solid outline of an adventure we can run for our players.\n\nWe're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us! If you want to improvise some stories, stretch your creative muscles, get help writing your adventures, or just have some fun brainstorming ideas - come join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D)!\n<br/>\n\n<div className=\"video-container\">\n<iframe className=\"video\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/grHP-de1p-U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n# How does it work? \nWe use a [brainstorming template](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template) to guide us through the adventure creation process. We copy it into a new google doc editable by everyone in the group, go through it step by step, and fill it with our ideas.\n\nWe use the [adventure prompts tool](https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts) to help us come up with the initial premise for our adventure. We take turns generating random prompts, and doing a short one-minute pitch of a story based on them.\n\n<!--  (we can also add the ideas that came up organically or ones we had from before) -->\n<!-- interesting premise,  -->\nWe brainstorm ideas and establish the key elements of our adventure: the goal our players will pursue, setting and locations they'll visit, characters they'll meet, challenges they'll encounter. For every step, we make a list of ideas, briefly discuss them, and pick our favorite ones.\n\nThen we try to combine our ideas into a one-page adventure, put it all together into a list of scenes that flow into each other, add up to an interesting story that makes sense. We use the [One-Page Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUqvSokoxJalKhi236xvl4q1cf7EWLVmrfgw9ljGyMI/) to create a short summary of everything we have brainstormed. We start by writing the outline (just a list of scene titles), then every person picks a couple of scenes and writes them.\n\n<!-- Now we have all the information we need to run the adventure for our players, or  -->\n\nFinally, we can [playtest](/playtesting) our adventure between ourselves to notice any issues, come up with more cool ideas, and practice running the adventure before we do it for our players.\n\nOur best adventures are published on this website, available to everybody on the internet for free (as long as everyone who has participated in the brainstorm is okay with that).\n<!-- playtests -->\n<!-- To get the most out of our brainstorming sessions read our [Brainstorming Guidelines](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-guidelines), they contain a list of useful tips that will help you to get better at brainstorming. -->\n\n# Brainstorming Guidelines\nTo get the most out of our brainstorming sessions, follow these tips and advice:\n\n<br/>\n\n<div className=\"columns\"> \n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Brainstorm what’s hard to improvise\nTry to make sure we have prepared everything that would be difficult to improvise on the spot, but no more. We don't want to over-prepare, it is safe to omit anything that the GM can improvise during the game. But we do want to make sure that we have prepared all the essential parts, and didn't leave any big unsolved open questions.\n\nIf you notice something that's missing or doesn't make sense - bring it up so that we can figure it out together.\n\n<!--  Prep what matters, don't prep what doesn't, spend our energy only on things that enhance the game. -->\n\n### Avoid discussing mechanics\nWe focus on creating system-agnostic, low-combat adventures. Stories that can be adapted to any system, that anyone can drop into their campaign as a quest, or run as a one-shot. Please avoid discussing rules and mechanics until the very end, because getting caught up in mechanics takes a lot of time and distracts people from the most challenging and interesting part - creating a story. Once we have a good story, it will be very easy to figure out the stats, rules, and combat encounters.\n\n### Keep up the good pace\nOur goal is to complete the adventure in 2-3 hours. If you notice that we're spending too much time on one specific section, encourage everyone to make a decision and move on to the next step of the writing process. It’s better to pick a random idea and roll with it than to get stuck trying to make a decision. If we find it difficult to choose the idea we want to focus on - we vote on it or roll the dice to pick a random one. \n\n### Try to keep the discussion focued\nPlease avoid going on unrelated tangents. If you notice that people are getting distracted, stuck, or too caught up in the details - try to steer the conversation back on track. It will really help us to complete the adventure within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n### Share the Spotlight\nTry to make sure you're not talking over other people and dominating the conversation. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.\n\n### Trust the process\nWe have established a process that works pretty well. If you're just getting started - try follow the lead of the person who's running the session, trust their experience.\n\n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Contribute ideas\nTry to contribute at least one idea to every step of the writing process. Doesn’t have to be the most brilliant one, even the simple/obvious ideas can be very helpful and lead to something interesting.\n\n### Yes, And\nDo your best to “Yes And” people’s ideas. Don’t shut down ideas - embrace them, build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better.\n\nSee if you can combine multiple ideas suggested by other people into something new and exciting - trying to incorporate other people's ideas into the story often leads to new and even more awesome ideas.\n\n\n### Take inspiration\nIf you’re struggling to come up with a creative idea - use one from your favorite Movie, Game, or a TV show.\n\nMix and match tropes. Combine two different ideas. Try to add an unusual unexpected twist. Change a key element of the idea, switch the genre, setting, goal, important character traits, etc. Take an idea that already exists, and try to make it different from what we've seen before.\n\nIf you need help coming up with ideas, use our [Writing Prompts Tool](https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts).\n\n### Useful learning resources\nCheck out our [adventure writing course](https://rpgadventures.io/course/adventure-academy).

Watch his full fantasy writing class [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBBfC8FY70c&list=PLTT-Xb7kSZWWdgWGER_CroAif3-BxYRJH). Listen to this excellent [screenwriting guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zdssotpnt2dmgfa/screenwriting-for-hollywood.mp3?dl=0) - it is very applicable to writing adventures, and it's the most brilliant summary of storytelling theory I've ever heard.\n\n### Invite people\nIf you know someone who would enjoy brainstorming with us, invite them to our server using [this link](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D). The more people we have - the easier it will be to find people to brainstorm with!\n\n### Run your own sessions\nOnce you've participated in a few sessions and feel like you're getting the hang of the process - feel free to announce and run your own sessions. It will enable you to brainstorm whenever it is the most convenient for you, and it will give an opportunity to more people (living in different timezones) to participate in the brainstorms.

Their goal is to guide people through the adventure creation process, keep the conversation on track, and do their best to make sure that we will be able to create a complete story within a reasonable amount of time (2-3 hours).\n\nYou're welcome to take initiative, announce, and run your own sessions.\n\n<!-- Anyone who has participated in a few sessions and gained some experience with the process is welcome to take initiative, announce, and run their own sessions. -->\n\n## Before The Session Begins\n\n### 1. Make a session announcement\nGo to `#session-announcements` and make a post like this:\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Session announcement [Post Template]\">\n\nHey, @everyone! Who's free to do some brainstorming at [time and date]?\n\nWe will try to make a [short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure set in a fantasy world (feel free to replace this with your own adventure type and genre)].\n\nWe will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes they go as long as 3 hours.\n\nI'm looking for 3-4 people. If you can join us - leave a message in this chat.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with our process or haven't read the guidelines yet - please read this post before we start our session: https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room\n\n</Collapsible>\n\nIt's best to limit the group size to 3-4 people. That way everyone has enough time to speak and contribute, things stay more manageable, and the process moves forward faster.\n\n### 2. Create a copy of our templates\nOpen the [Brainstorming Template](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-template) and click `File > Make a Copy`. Do the same with the [One-Page Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUqvSokoxJalKhi236xvl4q1cf7EWLVmrfgw9ljGyMI/).\n\nDon't forget to click `Share` and change \"Anyone with the link\" to \"Editor\" (so that everyone with the link can edit the doc).\n\n<!--\nChange the folder from \"Resources and Templates\" to \"Brainstorming Sessions Archive\". \n-->\n\n### 3. Before the session, post a reminder\n10 minutes before the session begins, make a post in `#brainstorming-text`:\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Session is about to begin [Post Template]\">\n\nHey, [@-mention people who signed up] !\nWe begin our brainstorm in 10 minutes, get ready!\n\nThis is the google doc we’ll be filling with our ideas, please open it before we begin:\n[google docs link]\n\nAlso open our adventure prompts tool:\nhttps://perchance.org/adventure-prompts\nWe will use it to help us generate ideas for our adventure.\n\nIf you haven’t read our brainstorming guidelines yet - please check them out here:\nhttps://rpgadventures.io/writers-room\n\n</Collapsible>\n\nIf you have less than 4 people, invite more people right before the session:\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Invite more people [Post Template]\">\n\nHey, @everyone! We begin our brainstorm in 10 minutes. We have a couple of spots open, feel free to join us if you want (we can have up to 4 people).\n\n</Collapsible>\n\n## During the Session\n\n### 1. Begin the session with introductions\nIntroduce yourself, and invite people to give brief introductions.\n\nIf you find it helpful, here's exactly what you can say:\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Introductions [Script]\">\n\nHey, everyone! Thanks a lot for joining, this is gonna be fun!\n\nLets start with brief introductions.\n\n- What should we call you?\n- What brings you here, why did you decide to participate?\n\nI'll start: \"I go by [Name]. I've decided to participate in these sessions because [reason, briefly]. I'm looking forward to brainstorming with you guys!\"\n\n</Collapsible>\n\n### 2. Make sure everything is working well\nMake sure that people have the Google Doc and the Adventure Prompts Tool open.\n\nAsk them to enter their nicknames at the top of the brainstorming template.\n\n<!--\n, so you don't forget (and so they try editing the doc)\n-->\n\n### 3. Briefly recap the brainstorming process\nExplain to people how our brainstorms work.\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Brainstorming process recap [Script]\">\n\nOur goal is to create a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure that any of us can run for our players.\n\nWe will aim for a 2 hour session, but sometimes it goes as long as 3 hours, depending on how much time we have, and how much we like the idea we came up with.\n\nWe will go through the template step by step, and answer the questions to guide us through the process of creating a story.\n\nWe will fill the template with our ideas, build on top of each other's ideas, discuss and pick our favorite ones, and try to turn them into a story - an outine of the adventure that gives us all the information we need to run it for our players.\n\nIf we really like the story we have created, and have about 40 minutes of time left - we can try creating a one-page adventure out of it, which we then share with our community.\n\n</Collapsible>\n\nExplain your role as a session guide:\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Session guide role [Script]\">\n\nMy job as a session guide is to do my best to make sure that we successfully create a good adventure within a reasonable amount of time. So I will be trying to guide the brainstorming process, keep our conversation on track, and keep us going forward at a good pace.\n\n</Collapsible>\n\n\nAsk if anyone has any questions about the process before we begin.\n\n### 4. Brainstorm the adventure idea\n\nGo through the idea brainstorming part of the template, brainstorm ideas, and select one idea you want to develop into the adventure. \n\n<Collapsible title=\"Some tips on running the brainstorming part of the session\">\n\n- Take the lead, be the first to add an idea to demonstrate how it works. Use the adventure prompts tool to come up with an idea, add it to the list.\n- Prompt the everyone else to do the same.\n- Build on top of their ideas to demonstate how collaborative brainstorming works.\n\nAfter you have brainstormed the ideas and created a list of Loglines - ask people which idea is their favorite. Highlight the selected idea in **bold** - that's the idea we'll be developing into the adventure.\n\n</Collapsible>\n\nAim to finish this part in 40-60 minutes.\n\n### 5. Develop the adventure idea\nGo through the rest of the steps and answer the questions in the template to develop the rest of the adventure.\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Some tips on running the session\">\n\n- Guide people through the process by asking them leading questions. Think about which is the most important part of the story that is still missing, and ask people to help you come up with the answer.\n- If they struggle - try to come up with a few examples (even simple/bad ones will do), and ask people to select their favorite and build on top of it.\n- Try to keep the conversation on track and do your best to encourage people to follow our [brainstorming guidelines](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room).\n- Try to engage shy/quiet people, ask them questions like \"Hey, [name], what do you think?\", \"What idea is your favorite?\"\n- Aim to complete brainstorming within 2 hours, but it's fine if it goes as long as 3. If some part of the process is taking too long - just pick the best idea you have so far, and tell people that it's time to move on (you can improve it later if you come up with something better).\n- If nobody has any good ideas (that almost never happens) - go with the simple/obvious one. Simple ideas have a tendency to develop into awesome ones as you go through the brainstorming process.\n- If you have 40 minutes left at the end, and really like the idea, use the One Page Adventure Template to turn the brainstormed ideas into a draft of an adventure.\n\n</Collapsible>\n\n<!-- - If people get stuck or can't pick an idea - call for a vote, roll the dice to pick a random one (`!r 1d10` in chat), or just make the decision yourself and move on. -->\n<!-- - If nobody has any ideas - go with the simple/obvious one. Use [writing prompts tool](https://rpgadventures.io/prompts) if necessary. -->\n\n\n## After The Session\n- If you really like the adventure - invite people for a playtest. Learn how to run playtests [here](/playtesting).\n- If you have enough time, energy, and enthusiasm for the idea - clean up the draft and turn it into a complete adventure which you can share with others. Use the `#work-in-progress` channel to discuss the adventure after the session. Once the adventure is complete, post it in `#finished-adventures`.\n\n\n<!--\nMake a list of things you'd like some help with - remaining open questions you're not sure how to answer, things you would like to improve, ideas to add, issues to fix. Post the link to the adventure draft and the list of questions in `#work-in-progress`, so that other people can help you out.\n\nIf everyone is cool with it, it would be nice to publish the adventure on our website and share it on reddit to grow the community.\n-->\n\n<!--\n- Dont forget to add everyone's name and discord handle to the list of the authors (at the top of the Brainstorming Template, and at the bottom of the One-Page Adventure Template).\n-->","html":"<h1 id=\"session-guide\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#session-guide\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Session Guide</h1>\n<h2 id=\"running-your-own-sessions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#running-your-own-sessions\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Running Your Own Sessions</h2>\n<p>The Session Guide is the person who announces and runs the brainstorming session.

If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game. When GMing, try to encourage players to follow these principles. \n\n<br/>\n\n<div className=\"columns\"> \n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Brainstorm what’s hard to improvise\nDuring the brainstorming part, try to make sure we have prepared everything that would be hard to improvise on the spot, but no more.\n\n<!-- \n -->\n\n### Take inspiration\nIf you’re struggling to come up with a creative idea - use one from your favorite Movie, Game, or a TV show. \n\nMix and match tropes. Combine two different ideas. Try to add an unusual unexpected twist. Change a key element of the idea, switch the genre, setting, goal, important character traits, etc. What makes it different from what we've seen before?\n\n### Play to find out what happens\nDo things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”.\n\n### Yes, and\nTreat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - embrace them, help them succeed. Adopt ideas, build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better. Help other players be awesome. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine. When GMing, listen to players and \"yes and\" their ideas. Build off of the details they contribute.\n\n### Share the Spotlight\nTry to make sure that all players have enough opportunities to participate in the story. Avoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation, but don't be afraid to speak up when you have something fun to contribute. Help quiet/shy players - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.\n\n### Keep the scenes short\nShorter scenes are better than longer ones. Start scenes as close to the action as possible, end them as soon as the interesting part over.\n\n### Keep up good pace\nPlease help me keep track of time. We're aiming for a 2-hour game. That's 30 minutes for brainstorming and creating characters, and two 10-minute scenes per Plot Point (or one big 20-minute scene). Adventure hook and resolution can be shorter, Climax can be longer. If you notice we're falling behind - let everyone know so we can wrap up the scene and move the story along.\n\n### Advance the Plot\nHelp the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.\n\n<!--  provide explanations for information that seems inconsistent, -->\n<!-- Vividly describe what you do.  -->\n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Contribute to the story\nDon’t be afraid to add information to the story. Help the GM to establish the scene, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the gaps, help to create a story that makes sense. \n\n### Be an active player\nDon’t wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone’s experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome. \n\n### Stay in character\nTry to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.\n\n### Develop your Character\nWhat are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment? \n\n### Goals and Motivations\nFigure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest? \n\n<!-- Don’t wait for the GM to provide every detail and tell you what to do.  -->\n\n### Explore the Relationships\nHow does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?\n\n\nCreate interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?\n\n### Ask Questions\nWhen GMing, draw players into the story by asking questions “How does your character feel about x?”, “What’s going through their head as they do y?”, “Describe how you want to do z.”\n\n### Grounded Story, Funny Roleplay\nWhen brainstorming/GMing, focus on creating a good, interesting story with a solid plot. Don’t try to make it funny, let the comedy come from interactions between players. Aim to create a grounded story that makes sense.\n\n<!--  - try to create a grounded believable world on top of which we can improvise funny and entertaining situations. -->\n\n<!-- an agreement, find a win-win outcome?  -->\n\n\n<!-- characters want opposite things?  -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- \n\n---\n## GMing\n\n\n### Rare rolls, meaningful consequences\nRoll the dice when succeeding or failing at the action could each contribute something interesting to the story. Don't roll for insignificant things.\n\nDon't let failed rolls to halt the story. \"Nothing happens\" should never be an outcome of a roll. Players should never get stuck at the door they can't unlock. Instead, roll for being able to pick the lock before the guards show up. \n\nThe situation should always change after a roll, for better or for worse, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goals. Each outcome moves the plot forward, takes the story in a different direction. Failure always leads to consequences - the characters suffer a temporary defeat, face a complication, or have to try a different approach.\n\n -->\n\n<!-- \nIt's not I fail to pick the lock and we're still standing there. It's I fail to pick the lock before the guards show up and now we're on the run from them!\n\nIt's not I fail to pick the lock and we're still standing there. It's I fail to pick the lock before the guards show up and now we're on the run from them!\n\n1) We shouldn't be doing mechanical tests for success if the outcomes won't matter (if either success or failure wouldn't be interested, why is the test revolving around this)\n2) Failure shouldn't stop continued play (\"being stuck at the door you can't unlock\").\n\n -->\n<!--  - things must get either better or worse for the heroes.  -->\n\n<!-- \n### Action and Combat Scenes\nDon't roll for separate attacks or actions. Use the dice to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points. \n\nResolve most fights in one roll. Describe how you're fighting, roll to see if you win. Defeating a fearsome enemy (like a dragon) may require 2-4 challenges (get close enough while avoiding it's attacks, pry open one of it's scales, land a killing blow).\n\nPlayers don't die, but you can describe how they got hurt and take it into account when deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.\n\n -->\n\n<!--  (unless they want their character to die when it feels dramatically appropriate) -->\n\n<!-- \n### Build on top of players ideas\nListen to players and \"yes and\" their ideas. Build off of the details they contribute.\n\n -->\n\n<!-- \n\n---\n\n## And don't forget...\n\n<div className=\"columns\"> \n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Relax and have fun\nIf you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Often an idea that seems simple and obvious to you will lead to something interesting. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you’re doing great! \n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Make Friends\nGet to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Roll should meaningful impact on the story, determine the outcomes of decisive moments, dramatically interesting turning points.  -->\n","html":"<h1 id=\"story-games-guidelines\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#story-games-guidelines\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Story Games Guidelines</h1>\n<p>Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our <a href=\"/story-games\">games</a>.

We go on imaginary adventures in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people. Together we improvise stories from scratch, with no preparation. It is a combination of roleplaying, brainstorming, collaborative storytelling, and improv. If you feel like stretching your creative muscles - come [join us](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD) on one of our adventures!\n\n## How to Play\n\n<div className=\"columns\"> \n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Brainstorm\nWe use the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg6jXg47vivpyKBfPQnO_SKSV0BIO1RMurGhRSc1rDA/\" target=\"_blank\">Story Template</a> to guide us through the game. First, we brainstorm to establish the important elements of our adventure: interesting premise, our goal, setting, characters, and challenges we may encounter. \n\n### Create Characters\nCreate the player characters, establish who they are, what abilities they have, their motivations and relationships.\n\n### Freeform Roleplay\nThen we roleplay - improvise the scenes of our adventure, trying to tell a fun story, making things up as we go. \n\nAll players actively contribute to the story, introduce new ideas, fill in missing information, create interesting situations, help to advance the plot and take the adventure in new directions.\n\nFreeform roleplay doesn't have many rules - there's nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play fairly - avoid gamebreaking actions, do things that make sense in the story, and try to make it interesting and fun for other players.\n\nTake a look at our [guidelines](/storygames-guidelines) to become a better player and get the most out of our games.\n\n\n### Tell a fun story\nWe win the game if we have created an interesting story that makes sense and resolves in an awesome and satisfying climax.\n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Playing Scenes\nThe Story Template contains a list of key plot points, we use them to guide our improv, strive to incorporate them into our story. \n\nWe can play up to three short (5-10 minutes) scenes per plot point, or one big one (no longer than 20 minutes).\n\n### Game Master\nOne player becomes a Game Master (GM) - the narrator of our story. GM describes the world around the players, plays the role of non-player characters, decides what challenge the players will face next, and narrates the consequences of their actions. \n\n<!-- The rest of the players play as their characters (PCs). -->\n\n### The Lead Player\nAfter establishing a scene, the GM chooses a PC who will take the Lead on dealing with the challenge. The Lead can choose one or two other PCs who will actively participate in the scene. The players describe their approach to solving the challenge, the outcome is determined by rolling dice.\n\n### Players take turns GMing scenes\nThe player who took the Lead in the last scene will GM the next one. \n\n### Collaborative Storytelling\nIf the current GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can ask other players for suggestions, or tap out and let someone else continue the story. When necessary, we can pause between the scenes for a quick brainstorm and figure things out together.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<!-- \n## Create your Character\n\nCopy this template, fill it in, post it in the game chat:\n\n\n> **\\*\\*Name\\*\\***: <Character's Name>  \n**\\*\\*Description\\*\\***: <Who are you? Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations.>  \n**\\*\\*Abilities\\*\\***: <What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, useful items.>  \n\nYou can use <a href=\"https://playmirage.io/all-powers\" target=\"_blank\">this list</a> of cool abilities and items for inspiration.\n\n -->\n\n<!-- \n> **\\*\\*Name\\*\\***: <Character's Name>  \n**\\*\\*Description\\*\\***: <Who are you?

What are your goals?>  \n**\\*\\*Relationships\\*\\***: <Your Connection to another PC and Tension between you.\\>  \n\nMotivations and Relationships are filled in during the game, after the brainstorm.  \nPick at least one PC to establish a relationship with.  \nConnection -  How do you know each other? What do you think about them?  \nTension - What do you want from them? Why do they refuse to give it to you?  \n\nYou can use <a href=\"/files/character-prompts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this list</a> of cool abilities, motivations, and relationships for inspiration.\n\n -->\n\n## Rolling Dice\nAfter you describe your approach to solving a challenge, roll a 20-sided die to determine the outcome. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed. Otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication. \n\nThe target number represents your likelihood of success, it depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you're in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?\n\nIf your character is using an ability relevant to the task you’re attempting, you roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result). Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage. \n\n\n<!-- \n -->\n\n<!-- \nAfter you describe your approach to solving a challenge, roll a 20-sided die to determine outcome.

GM uses their common sense to decide how likely the players are to succeed. Set lower numbers for easier tasks or clever solutions, set higher numbers for difficult challenges or reckless actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?\n\n### Consequences\nThe situation always changes after a roll, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goals. Each outcome moves the plot forward, takes the story in a different direction. Failure always leads to consequences - the characters suffer a temporary defeat, face a complication, or have to try a different approach.\n\n### Action and Combat Scenes\nDon't roll for separate attacks or actions. Use the dice to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points. \n\nResolve most fights in one roll. Describe how you're fighting, roll to see if you win. Defeating a fearsome enemy (like a dragon) may require 2-4 challenges (get close enough while avoiding it's attacks, pry open one of it's scales, land a killing blow).\n\nPlayers don't die, but you can describe how they got hurt and take it into account when deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.\n\n -->\n\n<!-- \nUse the dice to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points, not individual actions. Describe how you're fighting, roll once to determine whether you win or lose.\n\nDefeating a fearsome enemy (like a dragon) might require several challenges (get close enough while avoiding it's attacks, back it into a corner, pry open one of it's scales, use teamwork to land a killing blow), but it never happens blow-by-blow.\n\nIf players backed into a corner, and the situation gets severe\nPlayers don't have healthbars, but you can describe how they got hurt, making it more difficult to fight, and take it into account when setting target numbers for future challenges. Players don't die, but they can be forced to escape, get captured, left at the mercy of their enemies.\n -->\n\n<!-- Don't roll for separate attacks in a fight. Describe how you're fighting, narrate and roleplay a cool action scene, and roll once to determine whether you win or lose.  -->\n<!-- \noutcome of the scene.\nRoll a 20-sided die to determine successes/failures of major actions, significant outcomes. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed, otherwise you fail. On a failed roll, you can reroll the die at a cost of suffering a negative consequence, setback, complication, or taking a riskier option. \n\n(set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the challenge and your approach to solving it)\nOtherwise you fail and suffer a negative consequence, setback or complication that moves you farther away from your goals.\n\nIf you roll 1 - you suffer a severe setback, making your goal more difficult to achive.\n\nThe situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill, each outcome pushes the story forward. Failures always create new situations, the result is never \"nothing happens\". They change the story, make the scene end badly for the character, move you farther away from your goals, making them more difficult to achieve. When you fail - you or GM describe how this failure results in a complication/setback at your personal character goal, or at the main goal the party is pursuing on this quest.\n\nIf your character is using an ability or an item relevant to the task you’re attempting, you roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result).  \nType `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage.\n -->\n\n\n## Come play with us!\nCome join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD) to find other people to play with.\n\n## Play Offline\nTo play offline, you need a print out the <a href=\"/page/story-games/story-games.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">rules</a>.

Come up with an idea for your character\nDefine your name, appearance, personality, motivations, backstory.   \n\n<Collapsible title=\"Need help coming up with character ideas?\">\n\nIf you're struggling to come up with an idea for a character - take your favorite characters from the movies, books, or games you love, and change them in some way:\n\n- Adapt them to the genre you're playing in (take your favorite Sci Fi character, and adapt them to fantasy).\n- Change one of their key personality traits (take a cool villain and create a good version of them, take a shy and humble character and play an exccentric and outgoing version of them, take a high status character and play them as low status).\n- Reverse their physical characteristics (gender, age, appearance, etc).\n- Combine characteristics of two different characters into one.\n\nYou can google the lists of the top TV/Movie characters, and see which ones you can change in interesting ways, which ones have interesting aspects that you like could combine to create your own character.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Iron Man but in a fantasy universe - a brilliant aristocrat inventing steampunk machines in his spare time.\n- Low-status Gandalf - an ancient wizard shyly mumbling something about the powerful artifact that would be nice to destroy, if that's not too much of an inconvenience to you.\n- Female Yoda - an old goblin witch people always come to for wisdom and advice.\n\nAlternatively, you can start with appearance. Search websites like [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/search?sort_by=likes&category_ids=65&medium_ids=1), and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=fantasy%20character%20design&rs=typed&term_meta[]=fantasy%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=character%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=design%7Ctyped) for things like \"Fantasy Character Design\", or visit [/r/ImaginaryCharacters](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryCharacters/top/?sort=top&t=all). Find an image you find inspiring, and use it as a foundation of your character idea.\n\nFinally, you can start with a cool occupation, fantasy race, or a superpower you'd like to have, and build a character around that.\n\nIf all else fails - you can always just play as a fantasy version of yourself.\n\n</Collapsible>\n\n### 2. Choose up to 5 talents\nTalents are general areas you are really good at, they define what makes you more capable than an average person. They may include your innate strengths, background, occupation, knowledge, skills. Using talents will give you advantage on dice rolls, making you more likely to succeed at the tasks your character is really good at.\n\n<!--\nTalents are broad areas your character is really good at, they define what makes you more capable than an average person. Talents include your innate strengths, as well as expertise that comes from training and experience. \n\nDuring the game, you will roll the dice when you attempt to do something challenging.

Don’t shut down ideas. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for the other characters to shine.  \n\n### Share the Spotlight\nAvoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation. Help the quieter players to feel included - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.\n\n### Actively contribute ideas to the story\nDon’t be afraid to add information to the story. Try to describe things vividly, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the the missing information, help to create a story that makes sense. \n\n### Advance the Plot\nHelp the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.\n\n### Be an active player\nDon't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others. \n\nPositive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.\n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Stay in character\nTry to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.\n\n### Develop your Character\nWhat are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?\n\n### Goals and Motivations\nFigure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?\n\n### Explore the Relationships\nHow does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?\n\nCreate interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?\n\n### Engage Quiet Players\nIf you notice that someone hasn't spoken up in awhile - start an in-character conversation with them, for example ask them what they think about the current situation.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</Collapsible>\n\n<!-- \n### Allow yourself to feel\nThis game can get really amazing when you allow yourself to really feel what your character feels in the moment. When you feel safe to express emotions around your friends, and really care about your character and theirs, you will have some amazing and unforgettable moments.\n\n### Make Friends\nGet to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.\n-->\n","html":"<h2 id=\"roleplaying--guidelines\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#roleplaying--guidelines\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Roleplaying  Guidelines</h2>\n<p>Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our games.

Describe the world around the players, play the role of the NPCs, establish the challenge the heroes will face next, narrate the consequences of their actions.\n\nTo play the game you need an adventure. Find a list of premade adventures you can run for your players [here](/), learn how to create your own [here](/course/adventure-academy), or participate in our [adventure brainstorming sessions](/writers-room) where a group of GMs create a fun adventure together.\n\n<!--\nWorks only for playtesting where everyone already knows the adenture.\n\n## Collaborative GMing (Optional)\nIf several players want to try their hand at running the game, we can take turns GMing the scenes for each other.\n\nOne person temporarily becomes a GM, everyone else plays as their character. The current GM runs the game until we switch and someone else continues the story.\n\nIf the current GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can ask other players for suggestions, or tap out and let someone else continue the story.\n-->\n\n<!-- \nBefore the game, help the players to understand the rules and create their characters.\n\nDuring the game, tell players what’s going on around them, ask them what they want to do, and then use your imagination, common sense, and results of dice rolls to describe consequences.\n\nGive the players a task to accomplish (find the treasure, defeat a monster, save the princess). Put challenges on their path, obstacles to getting what they want. Watch them find creative ways to overcome them.\n\nImagine how the world responds to their actions, create and describe interesting consequences, add fun complications. Play the role of all NPCs like an actor, respond to what the players do the way these characters would respond.\n\nTry to bring the story to an awesome, dramatic, satisfying conclusion. Like an epic climactic showdown with the antagonist. Watch the heroes overcome their biggest challenge and reach their goal.\n-->\n\n## Rolling Dice (for GMs)\nBefore the roll, set the target number the player needs to beat in order to succeed at a task. Set lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. 5 is easy, 10 is standard, 15 is challenging, 18 is very hard. \n\n<Collapsible title=\"Dice Rolling Guidelines\">\n\n<div className=\"columns\">\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Rare rolls, meaningful consequences\nTell the players to roll only when both succeeding and failing at an action could each contribute something interesting to the story. The situation should always change after a roll, for better or for worse, each outcome pushes the plot forward, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goal. \n\n### Don’t roll for insignificant things\nIf you can resolve the situation without a roll - do so. Don't call for a roll if the character can do something very easily (Hulk trying to lift a car), or if the character can't possibly succeed (a kitten trying to lift a car).\n\n### Consider the situation\nTake into account not just the difficulty of the task, but also the situation players are in and their approach to solving the challenge. That way the players' choices and roleplaying matter to the likelihood of the success, not just their abilities.\n- Clever plan will have a lower target number than the reckless one.  \n- Passionate argument with well made points is more likely to persuade an NPC than a less convincing one.  \n- Injured hero will find it harder to perform physical tasks.  \n- Sneaking past the guard is easier if the players have distracted them first.\n\n### Don't roll for abilities, do roll for outcomes\n\nDon't ask for a roll to see whether the player can use an ability - they can't fail to cast a fireball or shoot a grappling hook gun. But they may still need to roll for an outcome - whether the fireball or a grappling hook hits its aim.\n\nThe exception is when you intentionally design an ability to have a limitation that makes it unpredictable, like an ability to summon a rampaging monster that turns against the summoner if they roll below 10.\n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Fail Forward\nFailed rolls always lead to negative consequences and complications, raising the stakes and making the story more dramatic. \n\nDon’t let failed rolls to halt the story - “Nothing happens” should never be an outcome of a failed roll, players should never get stuck at the door they can’t unlock. \n\nIf the action is required for the story to move forward, either make the success automatic, or roll for whether or not they encounter a cost or a complication:\n> The door opens but you have triggered an alarm and now guards are about to show up.  \n\n### Never roll for the same thing twice\nIf the players have failed a roll, they must try a different approach:\n> You broke your last lockpick, you have to try something else (bribe the guard, break the door, etc.).  \n\n> Your argument has failed to move the Barbarian and he looks angry (you can't roll for persuasion again, you have to try something else).\n\n### Using talents requires description\nIf the player wants to roll with advantage - ask them to describe how they're using their talent. The goal is to prompt players to narrate and roleplay, just saying \"I'm strong so I can do it\" is not enough.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</Collapsible>\n\nYou can split more challenging/elaborate tasks into multiple rolls:\n> Picking a lock is a single roll. To open a bank vault you might want to roll for disabling the alarm, breaking the lock, sneaking in in time to hide from the guard patrol.  \n> If the players want to sway an angry Orc to their side, tell them to roll for an attempt at calming it down, then for communicating in a way that it can comperhend, and finally for convincing it to follow the course of action players want.\n\n## Running Combat Scenes\nResolve combat the same way you resolve any other challenge in the game - with one or multiple (often 3-5) rolls. \n\nDon’t run combat blow-by-blow. Instead, roll to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points.\n\nThere are no hitpoints, fights are resolved narratively. Successful rolls move the players closer to victory, heroes progressively back the enemy into a corner until at some point they have an opportunity to land the final killing blow.\n> Wound the dragon’s wing to force it to land, distract it to help another player to get close, avoid its attacks, pry open one of it’s scales, land the killing blow.\n\n<Collapsible title=\"Example Combat\">\n\n- Players fall into the pit, a trap set up by goblins. Goblins start throwing rocks at them from above. Players describe how they dodge or hide from rocks. Roll the dice, if they fail they may have an injury or concussion we'll try to weave into the story.  \n- A player comes up with a plan to get out of the pit, rolls to see if they can. If they fail, goblins manage to push them back into the pit and players have to try something else, or maybe they successfully climb out but get hurt by goblin attacks in the process.  \n- Players describe how they're fighting goblins. We can do one roll per goblin, or even one roll to describe how the whole fight goes. If players fail, they're captured and carried away to the goblin camp (giving them an opportunity to do a prison break later), or just have to flee in shame.  \n- If players are winning the fight, the goblins might surrender, or run away for help, forcing players to give chase (one last roll).  \n\n</Collapsible>\n\nOn failed rolls, players take damage from the enemy’s counterattack, the situation gets more dangerous, victory is harder to achieve. Describe how the player got hurt and take it into account when narrating the consequences and deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.\n> The orc kicks one player onto the ground, wounds another, deflects the attack, disarms the last one. Now players have no choice but to flee or get captured.\n\nThe goal is to make combat feel like improvising a cool cinematic action sequence, as opposed to playing a turn based boardgame. You present players with interesting and high-stakes challenges, they use their creativity to invent cool solutions, roleplay the dramatic moments, vividly describe awesome actions.\n\n\n## GMing Guidelines\n\n<Collapsible title=\"GMing Guidelines\">\n\n<div className=\"columns\">\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Don’t over-prepare\nTry to make sure you have prepared everything that would be hard to improvise on the spot, but no more.\n\n\n### Yes, and\nListen to players and “yes and” their ideas. Let them take the story in their own direction, and build on top of their ideas. Play to find out what happens, don't try to force preplanned outcomes.\n\n###  Keep the scenes short\nShorter scenes are better than longer ones. Start scenes as close to the action as possible, end them as soon as the interesting part is over.\n\n### Follow the rule of cool\nThe more awesome, creative, or funny the player’s idea is, the more likely it is to work.  \n\n</div>\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Ask Leading Questions\nDraw players into the story and prompt them to roleplay by asking questions such as:\n\n- How do you feel about [x]?\n- What’s going through your head as you do [y]?\n- Tell me, what's an unusual detail that you notice about [z]?\n- How do you react when [another player] [does something]? What do you say to them?\n- Do you know anything about [place or a creature the character might be familiar with]?\n\nAsk them to describe how their actions, items, creatures, dwellings, etc. look like.\n\nOn a successful roll, prompt them narrate the whole outcome - “Describe to me how do you [defeat the enemy].”\n\n### Prompt interactions between players\nTry to create interesting interactions between players.
