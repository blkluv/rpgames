In order to survive and reach the colony, they will have to challenge the AI in charge of the ship\n\n## Background\n\nThe colony ship, Dream of Rain, has been orbiting a Class 2 inhabitable moon for eons. Hundreds of colonists lie in perpetual sleep, awaiting to arise from their stasis pods to start their new lives on an inhabitable world. \n\nThe Dream of Rain is operated by a computer brain, known as Mastermind. Mastermind has been tasked with getting the precious cargo of humans to an inhabitable world, but there has been a problem. The class 2 moon’s unpredictable weather patterns have confused Mastermind for hundreds of years and delayed the computer from sending the human pods down to the planet below. \n\nIn order to maintain good working order on the Dream of Rain, there are hundreds of support drones, each an identical cloned human programmed for a specific function to provide maintenance to the ship. The drones are manufactured organic life-forms that are born from vats. They are only interested in completing their purpose on the ship and will eventually break down and be recycled in the massive drone garden located on board. It is impossible to say for how long this cycle has been running on the Dream of Rain, but things are about to change….\n\n## About the Players\n\nThe players are drones made by Mastermind to maintain the ship. They look identical to one another but have different sets of skills to fix the ship that they are born with. Each player will pick a class such as, Sanitation, Maintenance, Support Technician, Extermination, Agriculture, or Mortician. The players each wear simple suits that have labels that state their function.\n\n## Act 1: The Birthing Pods\n\nA birthing pod is a vat of goo where each drone is created. The service provided is labeled on a birthing pod. If you are a janitor drone, you will continually be born out of the janitor drone birthing pod. It is your “mother” of sorts.\n\nAll the players wake up at the same time. Each player has an urgent service that must be performed at Shipping Dock: Elway.\n\nThe players wake up in their birthing pods, with an urgent task programmed into their brains, giving them a strong sense that they must get to Loading Dock: Elway at great haste.\n\nWhen the players awake they are surprised to see other drones in construction mechs wrecking their birthing pods! \n\nThe drones are more concerned with destroying the players’ pods, rather than attacking the players themselves.\n\nComputer screens on their suits blink red with commands to destroy [the drone types that the players belong to]. \n\n## Act 2: The Damage Done\n\nIt is clear that all is not right on the ship. Even though the players have just been born, order has not been maintained on the Dream of Rain. There are bodies of drones in the hallways, some are just bones, some are more fresh. There are large windows that show the ship is in orbit of a lovely green world.\n\nAt the center of the ship on the outside, there is a massive “brain” that has been assembled out of debris cannibalized from the ship. There are ripped holes in the ship and it is clear the Dream of Rain has sustained some kind of damage. \n\nIn the hallway, there is a massive billboard screen that has an advertisement on it for the colonists' new homes at the Shimmering Shores. The estimated time of arrival is overdue by 4000 years. Something has gone terribly wrong…\n\n## Act 3: Shipping Dock: Elway\n\nImmediately upon arrival it is very clear that there was a big battle here. Gravity is no longer working in the shipping dock and bodies and debris float around in the room. There are live electrical wires exposed. There are hundreds of pods of humans in stasis that have been moved to the shipping dock. Upon investigation, it appears that the human pods were attempted to be put in their launch sequence to send them down to the moon below. \n\n[ The PCs must be in zero gravity and avoid floating debris, live wires and bodies. Some of the bodies have the labels of the same jobs that players have. They may put two and two together and realize that those bodies are their own previous versions. ]\n\nThere is a flashing light on a monitor. When they reach the blinking light there is a recording of something in the past. In the recording the players will see the past version of themselves frantically trying to launch the humans in their pods. On screens there are flashing lights that say “Provide Human Proof” in big red letters. A huge hole is ripped open and sucks much of the loading dock out into space. Outside the big brain with blinking red lights can be seen looking into the room. \n\n## Act 4: The Bold Plan\n\nThe players will find themselves barricaded in Shipping Dock: Elway with the rest of the drones on the ship trying to destroy them. When they investigate the doors to launch the humans, they can tell that Mastermind has locked the doors and they cannot be opened without “Requiring Human Proof.”\n\nThe players may be stumped and if so, they can look outside and see floating around Mastermind, there are spacesuits. If they investigate one of the floating suits or the human pods, one of them, Jason Redding, was revived recently. The players may understand what they need to do in order to launch the human. They need to wake one of the dormant humans up and get him to Mastermind to provide proof of human override to launch the colony sequence. Jason Redding unfortunately died in the last attempt and is still floating outside. He was sucked out into the vacuum before putting on a spacesuit and the emergency locks sealed off the shipping dock. \n\nThe players will need to override the security measures to open the door if they want to reach Mastermind. \n\n## Act 5: Mastermind\n\nEither the players with or without a colonist are going to try to override Mastermind’s security protocols. Mastermind will not launch the pods without a human’s approval. Mastermind floats in the middle of the huge ring spaceship. The players must space walk and avoid junk to get to the brain. \n\nIf the players attempt to reach Mastermind, a door will open and drones in space suits and mechs will float out trying to stop the players. They must hurry!\n\n## Act 6: Proof\n\nIn Mastermind’s brain. There are screens that read. “Require Human Proof to proceed”\n\nOnce the screens are touched the screen says “Identify Love” and shows pictures of “Love” that computers are not able to understand. The players or the colonists may be able to click the right pictures to prove they are human. \n\nIf they pick correctly, Mastermind will show “initiating colony sequence.”\n\nDoors on all of the loading docks will open and the human pods will begin to launch towards the beautiful green planet below. \n\nPlayers may choose to end their lives here, since they have succeeded or get the colonist back to a pod to save them. Or perhaps they realize they are human as well and get themselves to a pod to start their new lives on the planet below. \n\n## Scene Template\n\nWhere does the scene take place? \n\nWho will the heroes encounter there?\n\n### Character Name\n\nAppearance, personality, occupation, motivations, powers.\n\nWhat challenge will they need to overcome? \n\n#### Read Aloud Text\n\nDescribe the location, characters, challenge, leads.\n\n“Relevant dialogue.”\n\nWhat important information will the players learn about the story? How does it lead them to the next scene?\n","html":"<h2 id=\"summary\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#summary\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this Sci-Fi adventure, the players will find themselves in a role of tech-support and maintenance clones on a colony ship.

Any lost ship that gets caught by the currents will eventually end up in this doomed place. \n\n<img className=\"frame medium\" src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/trash-island-cropped.png\"/>\n\nThose on land know that the fate of rudderless ships is to end up crashing on Isla Exilia, and purposely maroon their worst criminals by setting them adrift on a sabotaged, old derelict ship ready to be sunk. \n\nThe prisoners lucky enough to be thrown on the shores of Isla Exhilia before their ship falls apart have made a society for themselves, dwelling inside the wrecked ships and surviving off the bounty of the ocean.\n\nIn the middle of the island is Poseidon’s Wrath - an enormous Galleon set on its rear. It looms over the island like the leaning tower of Pisa (think the Titanic just before it sinks).\n\nOnce per year, a migrating Roc takes a brief rest on top of this ship. There are tales of foolhardy prisoners who managed to make the climb to the top, harness the Roc, and fly away to freedom.\n\nEach time the Roc arrives (the day known as The Coming of The Roc), the Leviathan rises from the depths of the sea and rears its head, preparing to strike. The legends say that the Leviathan has been hunting the Roc for thousands of years, and human sacrifice is the only way to appease its hunger, prevent it from attacking the Roc, and destroying the island.\n\n## Shipwrecked\nThe players begin their adventure sailing a small ship hopelessly caught by the strong currents, accelerating towards the shores of Isla Exilia until it hits some large underwater object and falls apart.\n\nThey must survive the shipwreck, avoid hungry sharks circling them,  and swim towards the shore - a stinking mound of debris, kelp, hulls of broken ships, and rotting carcasses of sea creatures.\n\nThe most perceptive players will notice faint shadows of enormous tentacles looming in the murky waters - the cause of their crash.\n\n<img className=\"frame\" src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/leviathan.jpg\"/>\n\n## The Doomed Place\nOnce the players arrive, they are surrounded by the prisoners, who seem to be in surprisingly good spirits. Prisoners are led by Captain Bluto, who commands to apprehend the new arrivals and take them to The Ring to “participate in the Festival”.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/king-shark-1.jpg\">\n\n## Captain Bluto\nCaptain Bluto, the leader of the prisoners, half-person half-shark (think King Shark from The Suicide Squad). Ruthless, ambitious, determined to escape the island at any cost.\n\t\n</CharacterBox>\n\nThe players are captured, restrained, and escorted to the circle of ships in the distance.\n\nWhile the party is being escorted, a peculiar prisoner approaches them and goes on about random bird facts.\n\n<CharacterBox  src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/skrank.jpg\">\n\n## Skrank\nCrazy, old bird enthusiast. He loves the Isla Exilia for all of the sea birds it attracts, and is obsessed with researching the Roc. He is missing a leg that he lost to one of the sharks. \n\t\n</CharacterBox>\n\nHe seems easy to dismiss as crazy, but he’s happy to share what he knows about the island and its history.\n\nHe tells them that if they survive the Festival (the sacrificial ritual to placate the Leviathan), they might have a chance of escaping this place. He offers his help in exchange for helping him to get to the Roc he wishes to fly on.\n\n## The Ring of Blood\nPlayers are escorted inside the circle of ships, which surround a large space of open water, where people are fishing, washing clothes, drying fish - The Ring is the center of this society and provides everything the prisoners need to continue their survival.\n\nThey watch as Captain Bluto summons a Pack of Wily Sharks, who take fish from his hand and  answer to him like a pack of vicious dogs. \n\n<CharacterBox>\n\n## The Shark Pack\nThis pack of sharks is intelligent like wolves and hunts as a pack. They are menace that keep the party moving and will take advantage of any moment to strike from the water. \n\t\n</CharacterBox>\n\n\nHe welcomes everyone to the Coming of the Roc Festival and informs them that this is the year he will get off this pile of rotten garbage. He shows everyone a hook and rope harness and is answered by cheers. He tells people to bring the offering of the prisoners so that the Leviathan will stay sated.\n\n<img className=\"frame\" src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/walk-the-plank.jpg\"/>\n\nPlayers watch as the first group of forlorn looking prisoners is being marched to the plank.\n\nAs the first prisoner is pushed off the plank, a huge tentacle rises up from the water, slices him in half mid-air, and drags him into the ocean. More prisoners begin to drop off the plank into the increasingly red waters below. The players are next.\n\nIf the players manage to escape, Captain Bluto will shout “What are you doing!? You will bring the creature down upon us all!!” \n\nWhen the ritual is interrupted, the Leviathan becomes enraged and begins lashing out at the island around it. All prisoners rush towards Poseidon's Wrath, which is now their only chance to survive and escape from the progressively decimated island.\n\nThe players will notice a rope dropped down from the crow’s nest that hangs crookedly above the pool - Skrank offering them a way out of the whirlpool of blood and angry tentacles. \n\n## The Crow’s Nest\nFrom Crow’s Nest players will see everyone rushing towards Poseidon’s Wrath towering in the distance.\n\n> “Atop the Poseidon’s Wrath is the Roc’s perch! We must hurry if we are to catch it before the others do!”\n\nSkrank will give the players a rope harness and a grappling hook explaining this is a one-way ticket off the island and motion with the hook that they can use to harness the bird and fly away attached to it by rope.\n\n> “There is a shortcut to the Poseidon’s Wrath, across the Flotsam Bridge but it will not be easy, especially for an old man with one leg!”\n\nThe players must figure out how to get to the Flotsam Bridge in a hurry. They can use ropes to make a zipline, fashion a large sheet of sails into a hang glider, cut down the crow’s nest causing it to topple, or find some other way down. \n\n## The Flotsam Bridge\n<img className=\"frame\" src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/sakaar-1.png\"/>\n\nThe “Flotsam Bridge” is the unstable part of the island, a field of floating garbage with a few large chunks of floating debris. \n\nThe players see prisoners running through the field, using hooks and ropes to jump from one floating pile of junk to the next. They will see a prisoner make a jump for it, only to get snatched mid-air by a shark leaping out of the water. This is going to be dangerous!\n\nThe sharks circling below wait for those who fall in the water to become their lunch, prisoners try to push each other and the party into water as they scramble towards the Poseidon’s Wrath. \n\n## The Poseidon’s Wrath\nThe Roc’s nest is on the very top of the ship, nearly two hundred feet in the air. If the Skrank is still alive, his one leg is going to make this climb difficult. There are holes and rotting wood everywhere. The players may choose to enter the ship or climb the hull from the outside. There are prisoners who are hastily making the climb as well, desperate to be the first to get to the Roc and fly away with him. \n\nThe massive weight of the Roc landing on the ship makes it creak, groan, crack and break in places. As they rush to the top, the rotting timbers of the boat will break under their feet, and the tentacles emerging from below may grab them and pull them close to the edge.\n\n## The Roc And The Wet Place\nOnce the Players emerge at the top of the Poseidon’s Wrath, the immense sense of the Roc is stunning. This bird could fly away with a couple elephants in its talons. The only prisoners who make it to the top are Captain Bluto and his cronies. All the others are either behind or have fallen. \n\n<img className=\"frame\" src=\"/post/sink-or-soar/roc.jpg\"/>\n\nThere is a dangerous fight at the top of the ship while in the shadow of the resting Roc, who plays no mind to the little fighters below him. Just then, at the height of the battle, the players and Bluto lose their footing, the boat shakes and to their horror, massive tentacles arise out of the debris and begin to swipe at the Roc, ripping Poseidon's Wrath to pieces! As it begins to collapse on itself the climbing prisoners scramble and fall. \n\nThe Roc takes flight, Bluto and any prisoners still alive throw their hooks onto the bird and are yanked off the collapsing boat. The Players either need to throw their hook and latch onto the Roc or hang onto one of the prisoners who are  hooked. \n\nAs the Roc flees the party sees the Leviathan destroy Poseidon's Wrath and break the island around it into small pieces.\n\nThe climax fight takes place on the ropes flying in the wind, attached to a flying Roc. Bluto and his prisoners will try to cut the ropes that the players are clinging to with their lives. Any fall from here down into the sea would be a certain death. \n\n  \n\n## Resolution\nThe Roc is much too large to notice anything hooked onto him, but if the fight turns too intense and bothersome, he might ruffle his feathers.\n\nThe Roc, players, and the surviving prisoners fly into the sunset and onto the next adventure. If Skrank is still alive he’s beaming with happiness, rattling off Roc facts, and planning to fly with him until he lands.\n\nFurther Adventures await!\n\nRoll credits (or perchaps, Roc credits?).\n\n---\n\n## Adventure Writers’ Room\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writers’ Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room).\n\nWe are a group of GMs who meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure (like this one) in 2 hours.\n\nWe’re looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!\n\nJoin our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D).\n\nSee the other adventures we have created [here](https://rpgadventures.io/).\n\nWatch the brainstorming session during which we have created this adventure [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBl8Yks-dY).\n\n**Authors**: Lumen, Flute, Mr.Peculiar, Zieve. \n\n**Art**: [Gabriel Loo-Carre](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/eaYnKG), [Snugglestab](https://www.deviantart.com/snugglestab/art/Leviathan-198103007), [Igor Pessoa](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/A9wVlq).","html":"<h2 id=\"summary\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#summary\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The players are shipwrecked on the shores of Isla Exilia - the dreaded trash island where the most ruthless of criminals are sent to live out their life sentences.</p>\n<p>Prisoners capture the players and attempt to use them in a sacrificial ritual designed to stop the Leviathan from destroying the island.</p>\n<p>The players must survive, evade a pack of trained sharks, race against the prisoners (led by the cruel half-man half-shark - Captain Bluto) to the top of a derelict Galleon (vertically stuck on its end, like sinking Titanic), and harness the Roc (an enormous bird) perched at the top - their only chance to escape and fly away to freedom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pdf-version\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#pdf-version\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>PDF Version</h2>\n<p>You can download this adventure in PDF format:\n<Downloads>\n{[{ name: \"Sink or Soar.pdf\", url: \"/post/sink-or-soar/sink-or-soar.pdf\"}]}\n</Downloads></p>\n<h2 id=\"setting\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#setting\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Setting</h2>\n<p>Out in the Sargasso sea, lies Isla Exilia - a twisted mess of shipwrecks, debris, and rotting carcasses of sea creatures.

They will need to reach the highest floor of Vizier's magical tower to acquire the magic wand that can turn the King back into a human. They will need to overcome Vizier’s minions and magical traps of his tower.\n\n## Outline\n- Characters **meet the rat** that gives them the scroll of Speak With Animals, explains the situation, and asks them for help.\n- They **meet Vizier’s minions** who have been chasing the rat.\n- They make their way through **the city streets** to the castle (where the Vizier’s tower is).\n- They find a way through the guarded **castle’s gates**, or hidden **catacombs**.\n- They make their way through the **floors of the tower** (filled with magical traps).\n- They **turn the King back into a human**, and **confront the Vizier**.\n- They **receive rewards** from the King, and **decide the fate of the Vizier**.\n\n## Introducing Characters\n\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/ship.jpg)\n\nThe players begin on a ship, about to arrive at the port.\n\n>\nYou have been sailing for several weeks now, your course is Cypress, the capital of Anglecynn, the biggest city on the whole continent. At this point you’re so tired of the ocean, you sincerely hope to never see a drop of water again in your life. Luckily, today is supposed to be the last day of your travels, you’re about to arrive.\n>\nYou're sitting at an old grimy table, on a middle deck of a ship, waiting for the miserable journey to end.  A piratey-looking sailor, with eyepatches on both of his eyes, comes up to you, pours himself a mug full of rum, and drinks it down in one gulp, and asks “: “What brings you to Cypress, mateys? And what do you look like? I'm really out of the loop here.” He points, sadly, at his eyepatches.\n>\n(It’s time to introduce your characters)\n\n## We see land!\n\nSailors notice the land, we're about to arrive:\n\n> As your conversation continues, suddenly you hear the voice from the upper deck “Land! We've made it! Thank the gods!” You weren't sure you would, successfully sailing to your destination in the medieval times is always a coin toss. You hear many excited voices and commotion from the upper deck.\n\nPrompt the players to go up to the upper deck and take a look:\n\n> The sailor stands up from the table \"Alright, mateys, I'll go up, take a loo...\" he cuts himself off, \"Smell some fresh air, I guess\" he finishes sadly. \"Follow me if you wish to see the City in all of its glory\"\n\n### Arriving into the Port\n\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/02_Dreamland.jpg)\n\nDescription of Cypress:\n\n> You walk up to the top deck of the ship, look ahead, and behold the glorious city of Cypress. A huge castle with white walls at the top of the cliff, and the city surrounding it. The city looks quite a bit scruffier than the castle, but it’s the most impressive one you’ve seen so far. Soon enough, your ship will arrive and dock in the bay.\n\nDescription of the Port:\n\n> You arrive at the port, the ship docks, and you finally feel the firm ground underneath your feet. You see many sailors running down the gangway onto the bustling boardwalk. Some of them drop on their knees, crying, kissing the earth. It’s been a long time for these dudes. Many ships are in this port, people are walking around, delivering cargo to and from the ships, selling their wares.\n\n## Meeting the Rat\n\nPlayers encounter the rat:\n\n> Amid all the hustle-and-bustle, you notice something very unusual - a fat ginger rat is scurrying directly towards you. It's noticeably distressed. In it's little teeth, it's carrying a scroll. You hear agitated squeaks. \"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nPlayers read the scroll:\n\n> It drops a scroll into your hand. You determine it to be a scroll outlining a spell “Speak with Animals.” Whoever touches it and reads it, shall gain the ability to speak to any animal for an hour. Works on multiple people.\n\n### Rat's Story\n\nThe Rat tells players it's story.\n\n> Once the spell is complete, you hear the Rat's frantic squeaking turn into comprehensible speech:  \n“...to you! Come on! Just read the damn scro…” the rat notices changes in your expression “Can you… Can you understand me now? Finally!”\n<hr/>\nDon't you see? Don't you get what is going on? Traitors! Backstabbers! Charlatans!\n<hr/>\nWhat am I? What am I? I'm the king of this bloody kingdom, that's who I am!! And you must help me! You're the only ones who can.\n<hr/>\nMy vizier, Jafar, the treacherous bastard, has turned me into a rat and he's currently sitting on my throne ruling my kingdom! Consolidating power.\n<hr/>\nYou must help me retrieve his wand of transfiguration, that's the only way to turn me back. He keeps it in his tower, the tower is in the castle.\n\nThe King attempts to command the players to rescue him, if that fails he will promise much gold and favors in return for their help.\n \n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/rat.png\">\n\n## King Amathar\nVery pompous and self-important, he's used to sycophants and yes-men hanging on his every word and satisfying his every whim. Being turned into a rat did nothing to humble him, and he keeps being surprised and frustrated that people don't instantly follow his squeaky commands.\n\nHe's pretty sure that he's the greatest, most beloved King that he's ever lived. Is he? Meh, he's alright. Not the most competent king who's ever lived, but better than Jafar, and just sympathetic enough to be worth helping.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n## Meeting the Minions\n\n> The rat is interrupted, and looks back behind it. \"Oh no, they're here!\"\n\n> You feel the earth underneath your feet slightly tremble and hear thud-thud-thud of heavy footsteps. You see a huge figure of a half-orc running towards you, his eyes locked on the rat. \n\n> The first thing you notice about him is his huge heap of beautiful brown hair, it's like, what shampoo is this guy using to make it so magnificent? Anyway, the second thing is a huge club in his hand that half the size of your body. It seems to have a few blood stains and someone's teeth stuck to it. He stops a few paces away from you, panting, looks around, and notices the rat.\n\nZug is searching for a Rat he accidentally let escape.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/guz.png\">\n\n## Zug\nZug is a half-orc that was tasked with guarding the rat, and he's now really worried he'll be in trouble because the rat has escaped. He's simple but loyal (think Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove).\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nZug will do his best to negotiate with the players, but if he senses it's not working he'll skip to violence:\n\n>- Um... Hello... I am, uh, Zug. This rat belongs to the Master, please step aside, I'll go ahead and take it back now.\n- Zug will be in so much trouble.\n- It is of great sent-ee-mental value to the Master. Negoni, netogi, negonitate!\n- I must get it, you see, Mr Jafar told me to guard it, Zug will be in so much trouble if he finds out it escaped.\n\nPlayers can fight him, fool him, or even befriend him.\n\nBefore the conversation begins to die down, the new character enters the scene:\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/gretchen.png\">\n\n## Gretchen\nAngry old Hag, Jafar's main minion/partner. They both have blackmail on each other and they both owe favors to each other. She was the one who has found the wand and helped Jafar to execute his plan. Now she'll stop at nothing to get the King back. She's frail but really smart. (Izma from The Emperor's New Groove).\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nGretchen is Zug's perpetually angry and disappointed boss who's here to lead the search and make sure that her minion doesn't screw up again.\n\n\n> You see an old woman catching up with Zug. And when I say old I mean fucking OLD, like she was born before calcium was invented. She is surprisingly spry though.\n- Zug! What the hell are you doing?\n- I'm, uh... I want to get the kin.. I mean rat, but they won't give it.\n- So hit them on the head with a stick and take it!\n- I was trying the, uh, diplomacy.\n- Just get the rat you idiot!\n- Okay…\n- Pazuzu! Where the hell are you, you useless animal! Get the rat, get the rat!\n- You kids, give me the rat! I don’t have time for your nonsense.\n\nHigh in the sky, the players will notice the third minion:\n\n> You see a strange shadow flying high in the atmosphere. Too large for a bird, too small for a blimp. What is it? You have no idea. It circles around, ominously, then begins to descend in the direction of the hag.\n\nPazuzu is here to provide aerial support to his cronies.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/pazuzu.png\">\n\n## Pazuzu\nA gargoyle with a difficult personality. He will be circling the skies above the city, making it necessary for players to stay hidden as they make their way to the castle. \n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nIf the scene with Zug/Gretchen takes too long, he'll join the battle, try to capture the rat, and return it to the Vizier's tower. If the players escape before this happens, or defend the rat, the rat will be able to help them find the castle, give them tips, tell them about secret catacombs. Otherwise they'll need to make it to the tower on their own, and rescue the rat along with the wand.\n\n## Cypress\nThe rat will tell the players which way to go, the biggest challenge is to get through the city unseen from the sky.\n\n### City Streets\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/03_city-streets.jpg)\n\nCity streets are pretty unremarkable:\n\n> People are bustling around, going by their daily business.\n\nPlayers can find a magic item shop, weapons shop, potions shops, a tavern.\n\n### Town Square\n\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/04-city-center.jpg)\n\nPlayers arrive at the city center. To reach the gates(or catacombs) they have to cross a wide open area not covered by buildings, without being seen from the sky.\n\n> You arrive at the town square. You see the castle gate in the distance. \n\n### City Gates\nCity gates are heavily guarded. Players will have to somehow sneak or talk their way through the guards(it looks like fighting through them is not something players can survive)\n\n> The draw bridge is down, but the gate is guarded by two guards.\n> Guards:\n- Stop right there! State your business!\n\nIf the players tell the truth:\n\n> One guard turns to another one:\n- That is the stupidest lie I have ever heard, huh, bobby\n- No doubt.\n\n### Gunther\nIf the players are really stuck, they'll see a peasant name Gunther giving them a look. He will offer to sneak them through the gates inside one of the barrels he's delivering for the feast, as long as they give him a very valuable item, and name their first born after him.\n\n> You notice one of the peasants is trying to look like he's just minding his own business, but his eyes actually dart at you, he seems to be observing you.\n> Hey fellas. I'm Gunther. I see you want to get into the castle. I can help cha, I can sneak you in my cart, inside the barrels. But it'll cost cha. \n\n### Catacombs\n\nThe king may tell the players about the secret passege to the castle through the catacombs, if they ask. There's a door to the catacombs underneath the bridge. The door is locked. Inside the catacombs it's dark, and if you feel like adding an extra challenge, there can be a pack of dog-sized rats with glowing eyes. Also, one of the tunnels may have collapsed, and the players may need to move heavy stones out of the way.\n\n> You see small points of light glowing in the dark. As you come closer, you see it’s the eyes of a bunch of mean looking dog-sized rats.\n\n## Tower\n<img className=\"small frame\" src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/05-wizard-tower-1.png\"/>\n\nAfter players make their way through the catacombs or through the gate, they see Jafar's tower:\n\n> You enter a castle, and have no trouble noticing a tall, slender, magnificent tower that is, well, towering over you.\n\n### Tower Entrance\nThe only way into the tower is through the giant metal gates. They are sealed by magic, they have no obvious lock, but they have a handle in the shape of a snake, and a bell.\n\n**Snake Handle**\n\n> You see a door handle in a shape of a snake. Small emerald eyes reflect the sky, making it seem almost alive.\nIf the player touches the snake handle, it comes alive and bites them. Now they're poisoned, and will lose one HP per minute, until they find the antidote (Laboratory in the tower has a lot of potions).\n\n**Door Bell**\n\nDoor bell answers in an autoresponder voice and lets them in:\n\n> Say \"One\" if you dare to request an audience with the Vizier. Say \"Two\" if you come bearing gifts for his lordship. Say \"Three\" if you feel unworthy to even be in his presence. Say \"Four\" if you and would like to take this opportunity to walk away before incurring his wrath. Say \"Five\" if you would like to proceed against your better judgment.\n\n### Reception\nThe first floor has a receptionist (clay golem) sitting in the middle behind the table. Next to the walls are 5 large empty suits of armor - the security system. If the receptionist feels threatened, they can activate them, making them come alive and attack the players.\n\n> The room seems unnaturally enormous, way larger than the tower looks from the outside. You see a square table, and behind it a small clay golem. It seems to be polishing it’s nails and staring at a small hand-held mirror, talking to someone on the other side \"And I told him, not today mister. And then he was like, I don't care. And I was like, ugh, You know what I mean?\"\n\nThe receptionist will ask them if they have an appointment, and check it's records to see if what they're saying is true. Players can try lying, using illusions, or subduing it before it can trigger the alarm.\n\nAfter receptionist has been dealt with, the players can go up to the next floor by using the staircase.\n\n### The Office\n\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/the-office.jpg)\n\nThe second floor of the tower is the Vizier's office:\n\n> The room looks like the office where he holds political meetings. It has a large desk in the center, papers, all neat and tidy. A crystal globe standing off to the side.\n> There's a portrait of a man with big mustache on the wall, his eyes, and his moustache, seem to follow them wherever they move. A set of diplomas and impressive looking papers hang around the painting. “Most Creative Use Of A Bigby’s Hand Spell”, “In recognition of contributions to the Most Noble Art of Conjuration”,  “Graduate of the Arcane Arts at Samadar’s School For Gifted Youths”. Portrait, crystal on his desk.\n\nIf a player decides to activate the crystal (by touching it and funneling 1 point of energy into it), they will see a vision of many things, among them - the location of the wand and Vizier sitting on the throne:\n\n> When you touch the crystal, the time and space unfold in front of his vision. He sees flashes of images. A giant empty cathedral. A dragon sleeping on a pile of gold. A round room with a desk, somewhere high above, with a glowing rod laying among it's contents. A vampire drinking blood from the neck of a young maiden. A tall slender man sitting on a throne. A city the likes of which you've never seen, gleaming with light, with buildings as tall as the sky, horseless carriages driving back and forth on the straight lines of it's roads. A giant tentacled creature dwelling in the depths of the ocean. An old man playing fetch with his dog.\n\n### The Laboratory\n\nThe next floor is Vizier's laboratory.\n\n> It looks like a study, or a laboratory. A desk filled with vials and bubbling potions(unlabeled). A pentagram on the floor, with a tiny demon-like creature sitting in the middle, looking bored. A small cage with an ordinary looking coffee table sitting inside it, whimpering pitifully.\n\nIf the players decide to open the cage with the animated coffee table - it will happily run off to it's freedom. If they interact with the demon-like creature, it will say something mean in the language they don't undersand, show them a rude gesture, and get back to looking bored.\n\nOne of the potions contains the antidote to the snake handle's venom, but potions are unlabeled. Drinking them randomly will produce random effects - reversing the gravity for the player, making them hallucinate, making them fall in love with whatever they're looking at, etc.\n\n### The Observatory\n\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/observatory.jpg)\n\nThe next room is where Vizier studies parallel dimensions:\n\n> There’s a huge telescope in the middle of the room, maps of the starlit sky, and what looks like a model of some kind of planetary system. The room is illuminated by ominous rays of red light streaming from the window.\n\nIf the players look out of the window, they'll see:\n\n> As you pass by the window, you inadvertently see a deep blue sky, above the dark red ocean. Three red moons illuminate the strange scene.\n\nWhen a player steps into the red light:\n\n> You feel something deep inside of you awaken, the primal rage, the thirst for blood. You look at your companions. Why have you never thought your companions would make for a good breakfast?\n\nThe window can be blocked by something opaque.\n\n### Top Floor\nAt the top floor the players will find the desk with a wand laying on top of it:\n\n> On the table nearby you see a rod you saw in your vision. The rod emits green light and a quiet humming sound. Once you take it, you feel mighty and powerful, like anything in the world could be reshaped according to your will. You hear the whale of an alarm, and soon, footsteps from the lower floors of the tower.\n\nIn the middle of the room is the portal gate:\n\n> In the center of the room you see a large obsidian circle, large enough to walk through, standing vertically on a pitch black pedestal. It looks like a strange gate.\n\n## Transforming the King\n\nWhen the rat sees the wand:\n\n> The Rat jumps up and down on your shoulder, forgetting any shreds of the kingly dignity it had left, unable to contain it's excitement.\n\nWhen a player activates the wand to transform the rat:\n\n> With the sound of thunder and lightning, the room fills with the blazing green light. Streams of mana and energy surround the Rat in a blinding whirlwind of light and power. You can barely see the shape of the Rat growing, changing. Surprised squeaks gradually lower in pitch, becoming shrieks and then grunts of a human.\n> As the magic and might begin to settle, you behold with your own eyes the majesty of the true king of this kingdom in his natural, human form.\n\nAt last, the king is free.\n\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/king.png\">\n\n## King in his human form\nKing turns into a human in all his grumpy and disheveled glory.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n### Throne Room\n![](/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/throne-room.jpg)\n\nIf the players activate the portal gate, it will open a wormhole into the throne room:\n\n> After you finish your manipulations, the space inside the circle seems to disappear, as if the hole has been torn through the universe, and on the other side, you see the throne room, a tall slender man sitting on the throne, and a few dozen of guards around him.\n\nJafar enjoys his time ruling the kingdom and ordering people around.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/jafar.png\">\n\n## Jafar\nTreacherous and obsequious Vizier. Extremely competent, probably more competent at running the kingdom than the King, but his intelligence is only used to further his own goals (Little Finger from Game of Thrones).\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n\nJafar looks surprised and shocked.\n\n> \"Your Majesty! I'm so happy to see you again! Everybody, rejoice, the lost king has returned!\"\n\nIf by the time players are in the throne room the king is still in the rat form, the guards will follow Vizier's commands, otherwise they will do what the King tells them to.\n\nVizier will try to talk/grovel his way to King's mercy, or set the guards on players and try to fight them.\n\n### Conclusion and Rewards\nOnce the Vizier has been defeated, the King will attempt to save face and take credit by claiming that it was his \"brilliant leadership\" that has secured this victory, but in the end, will be grateful to the players, and grant each player a request (if they remind him that he owes them).\n\n> \"Is the gratitude of the king not enough for you people? Fine!\" The King snaps his fingers in the direction of one of his servants. \"Ignacius, dash to the treasury, fetch us some of the finest \\[whatever players ask\\].\n\n<br/>\n\n---\n\nSee the playtest of this adventure [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn9vV_wHpY4).\n\n<CourseCTA/>\n\n<!--\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.

At this point you’re so tired of the ocean, you sincerely hope to never see a drop of water again in your life. Luckily, today is supposed to be the last day of your travels, you’re about to arrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You're sitting at an old grimy table, on a middle deck of a ship, waiting for the miserable journey to end.  A piratey-looking sailor, with eyepatches on both of his eyes, comes up to you, pours himself a mug full of rum, and drinks it down in one gulp, and asks “: “What brings you to Cypress, mateys? And what do you look like? I'm really out of the loop here.” He points, sadly, at his eyepatches.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(It’s time to introduce your characters)</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-see-land\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#we-see-land\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>We see land!</h2>\n<p>Sailors notice the land, we're about to arrive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As your conversation continues, suddenly you hear the voice from the upper deck “Land! We've made it! Thank the gods!” You weren't sure you would, successfully sailing to your destination in the medieval times is always a coin toss. You hear many excited voices and commotion from the upper deck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prompt the players to go up to the upper deck and take a look:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sailor stands up from the table \"Alright, mateys, I'll go up, take a loo...\" he cuts himself off, \"Smell some fresh air, I guess\" he finishes sadly. \"Follow me if you wish to see the City in all of its glory\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"arriving-into-the-port\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#arriving-into-the-port\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Arriving into the Port</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/02_Dreamland.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Description of Cypress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You walk up to the top deck of the ship, look ahead, and behold the glorious city of Cypress. A huge castle with white walls at the top of the cliff, and the city surrounding it. The city looks quite a bit scruffier than the castle, but it’s the most impressive one you’ve seen so far. Soon enough, your ship will arrive and dock in the bay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Description of the Port:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You arrive at the port, the ship docks, and you finally feel the firm ground underneath your feet. You see many sailors running down the gangway onto the bustling boardwalk. Some of them drop on their knees, crying, kissing the earth. It’s been a long time for these dudes. Many ships are in this port, people are walking around, delivering cargo to and from the ships, selling their wares.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"meeting-the-rat\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#meeting-the-rat\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Meeting the Rat</h2>\n<p>Players encounter the rat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amid all the hustle-and-bustle, you notice something very unusual - a fat ginger rat is scurrying directly towards you. It's noticeably distressed. In it's little teeth, it's carrying a scroll. You hear agitated squeaks. \"Squeak squeak squeak!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Players read the scroll:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It drops a scroll into your hand. You determine it to be a scroll outlining a spell “Speak with Animals.” Whoever touches it and reads it, shall gain the ability to speak to any animal for an hour. Works on multiple people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"rats-story\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#rats-story\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Rat's Story</h3>\n<p>The Rat tells players it's story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once the spell is complete, you hear the Rat's frantic squeaking turn into comprehensible speech:<br>\n“...to you! Come on! Just read the damn scro…” the rat notices changes in your expression “Can you… Can you understand me now? Finally!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\nDon't you see? Don't you get what is going on? Traitors! Backstabbers! Charlatans!\n<hr/>\nWhat am I? What am I? I'm the king of this bloody kingdom, that's who I am!! And you must help me! You're the only ones who can.\n<hr/>\nMy vizier, Jafar, the treacherous bastard, has turned me into a rat and he's currently sitting on my throne ruling my kingdom! Consolidating power.\n<hr/>\nYou must help me retrieve his wand of transfiguration, that's the only way to turn me back. He keeps it in his tower, the tower is in the castle.\n<p>The King attempts to command the players to rescue him, if that fails he will promise much gold and favors in return for their help.</p>\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/rat.png\">\n<h2 id=\"king-amathar\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#king-amathar\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>King Amathar</h2>\n<p>Very pompous and self-important, he's used to sycophants and yes-men hanging on his every word and satisfying his every whim. Being turned into a rat did nothing to humble him, and he keeps being surprised and frustrated that people don't instantly follow his squeaky commands.</p>\n<p>He's pretty sure that he's the greatest, most beloved King that he's ever lived. Is he? Meh, he's alright. Not the most competent king who's ever lived, but better than Jafar, and just sympathetic enough to be worth helping.</p>\n</CharacterBox>\n<h2 id=\"meeting-the-minions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#meeting-the-minions\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Meeting the Minions</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rat is interrupted, and looks back behind it. \"Oh no, they're here!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You feel the earth underneath your feet slightly tremble and hear thud-thud-thud of heavy footsteps. You see a huge figure of a half-orc running towards you, his eyes locked on the rat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first thing you notice about him is his huge heap of beautiful brown hair, it's like, what shampoo is this guy using to make it so magnificent? Anyway, the second thing is a huge club in his hand that half the size of your body. It seems to have a few blood stains and someone's teeth stuck to it. He stops a few paces away from you, panting, looks around, and notices the rat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zug is searching for a Rat he accidentally let escape.</p>\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/guz.png\">\n<h2 id=\"zug\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#zug\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Zug</h2>\n<p>Zug is a half-orc that was tasked with guarding the rat, and he's now really worried he'll be in trouble because the rat has escaped. He's simple but loyal (think Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove).</p>\n</CharacterBox>\n<p>Zug will do his best to negotiate with the players, but if he senses it's not working he'll skip to violence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Um... Hello... I am, uh, Zug. This rat belongs to the Master, please step aside, I'll go ahead and take it back now.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Zug will be in so much trouble.</li>\n<li>It is of great sent-ee-mental value to the Master. Negoni, netogi, negonitate!</li>\n<li>I must get it, you see, Mr Jafar told me to guard it, Zug will be in so much trouble if he finds out it escaped.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players can fight him, fool him, or even befriend him.</p>\n<p>Before the conversation begins to die down, the new character enters the scene:</p>\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/gretchen.png\">\n<h2 id=\"gretchen\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#gretchen\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Gretchen</h2>\n<p>Angry old Hag, Jafar's main minion/partner. They both have blackmail on each other and they both owe favors to each other. She was the one who has found the wand and helped Jafar to execute his plan. Now she'll stop at nothing to get the King back. She's frail but really smart. (Izma from The Emperor's New Groove).</p>\n</CharacterBox>\n<p>Gretchen is Zug's perpetually angry and disappointed boss who's here to lead the search and make sure that her minion doesn't screw up again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You see an old woman catching up with Zug. And when I say old I mean fucking OLD, like she was born before calcium was invented. She is surprisingly spry though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Zug! What the hell are you doing?</li>\n<li>I'm, uh... I want to get the kin.. I mean rat, but they won't give it.</li>\n<li>So hit them on the head with a stick and take it!</li>\n<li>I was trying the, uh, diplomacy.</li>\n<li>Just get the rat you idiot!</li>\n<li>Okay…</li>\n<li>Pazuzu! Where the hell are you, you useless animal! Get the rat, get the rat!</li>\n<li>You kids, give me the rat! I don’t have time for your nonsense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>High in the sky, the players will notice the third minion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You see a strange shadow flying high in the atmosphere. Too large for a bird, too small for a blimp. What is it? You have no idea. It circles around, ominously, then begins to descend in the direction of the hag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pazuzu is here to provide aerial support to his cronies.</p>\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/tokens/pazuzu.png\">\n<h2 id=\"pazuzu\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#pazuzu\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Pazuzu</h2>\n<p>A gargoyle with a difficult personality. He will be circling the skies above the city, making it necessary for players to stay hidden as they make their way to the castle.</p>\n</CharacterBox>\n<p>If the scene with Zug/Gretchen takes too long, he'll join the battle, try to capture the rat, and return it to the Vizier's tower. If the players escape before this happens, or defend the rat, the rat will be able to help them find the castle, give them tips, tell them about secret catacombs. Otherwise they'll need to make it to the tower on their own, and rescue the rat along with the wand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cypress\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#cypress\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Cypress</h2>\n<p>The rat will tell the players which way to go, the biggest challenge is to get through the city unseen from the sky.</p>\n<h3 id=\"city-streets\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#city-streets\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>City Streets</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/03_city-streets.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>City streets are pretty unremarkable:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People are bustling around, going by their daily business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Players can find a magic item shop, weapons shop, potions shops, a tavern.</p>\n<h3 id=\"town-square\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#town-square\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Town Square</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/post/wild-rat-chase/illustrations/04-city-center.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Players arrive at the city center. To reach the gates(or catacombs) they have to cross a wide open area not covered by buildings, without being seen from the sky.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You arrive at the town square.

There's a door to the catacombs underneath the bridge. The door is locked. Inside the catacombs it's dark, and if you feel like adding an extra challenge, there can be a pack of dog-sized rats with glowing eyes. Also, one of the tunnels may have collapsed, and the players may need to move heavy stones out of the way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You see small points of light glowing in the dark.

The players will need to set her free from the Coliseum where she is forced to fight monsters and gladiators for public's entertainment.\n\n## Stroll through the Forest\n![](/post/damsels-and-dragons/forest.jpg)\nThe players walk through the forest, and hear the sad roars in the distance. \n> You have been traveling together for awhile, passing the fields, rivers, and small villages. Now you're walking down a narrow road through the shady forest, it’s quite quiet and peaceful. Suddenly, you hear a roar in the distance, then again - a little louder this time. It seems to be coming from the direction you’re headed.\n\nThe roars are coming from some mysterious beast dwelling in a forest clearing ahead of the players.\n\n> Ahead of you, you see a few sun rays breaking through the trees - a clearing. The roars are coming from that direction. \"Raaaawwwwrrrr!!!\"  \n\n## Meet Kimba\nWhen the players approach, they'll see that the roars are coming from a crying child dragon.\n\n> You come to the edge of the clearing. In the middle of it - holy pony, is that a dragon? Certainly looks like one - bronze skin, scales, wings - all there. Not a large one though, about the size of an elephant, it seems to be very young. It has curled up in the middle of a clearing. It notices you, slowly lifts his head, and howls. Strangely sad, heart-wrenching sound. Is it crying?\n\nThe dragon's name is Kimba, and he's uncharacteristically low-spirited today.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/damsels-and-dragons/kimba.jpg\" frame>\n\n## Kimba\nYoung dragon, like an 8 year old kid (think Simba, or Russel from \"Up\").\n\nAlways curious, chattering away.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n\n\nHe's sad because the evil people took his mama:\n> ## Kimba's Story\n\"Are you here to take me, like they took my mama?\"\n<hr/>\n\"They took my mama! The bad people! They took her away! I'm all alone now.\"  \n<hr/>\n\"The warriors! In black armor, with big swords and spikes! She fought so hard to protect us, but they attacked her, and cast spells on her, and, and, and they captured her! And chained her, and put her in a cage, and took her away!\"\n\nIf the players offer to help:\n> The dragon looks at your faces, clearly confused. \"You're so nice! My name is Kimba. My mom's name is Malinda. She's really kind and brave and strong! She's the best dragon.\"  \n\n## Finding the City of Lyra\nKimba doesn’t know where they took his mom, only the direction. \n\nIt's easy to find tracks left by the fight, and an army of warriors and wizards dragging the enchanted dragon into the city. Exploring around the forest will also reveal the road to the north, leading to the city.\n\n> In the distance you see the city with tall walls of yellow stone and beautiful white towers.\n\n## Yeti Hunters\nOn their way to the city, the players will see a group of warriors delivering a huge iron cage to the city, inside - a gigantic Big Foot.\n\nLeading the warriors is Edgar - the Captain of the Guards.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/damsels-and-dragons/edgar.png\">\n\n## Edgar (Guard Captain)\nThe Captain of the Guards. Sick of his job, his honor makes him follow Cecilia's orders, but his common sense tells him that it's a horrible idea most of the time.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nThe warriors can tell them that they're gathering creatures on Princess Cecilia's orders - the young princess likes watching monsters and gladiators fight her new dragon at the Coliseum in the center of the city. \n\n> ### Edgar\n\"We bring her monsters and eldritch creatures from far away lands. Many good men died on this quest. Once we're done with this Yeti, we are to bring our glorious Princess a Basilisk.\"\n>\n\"*I hate my job*\" he mutters to himself.\n\n## Getting into Coliseum\nThere's a long queue of nobles on their way to watch the today's show (the spectacle is just for the rich). All entrances are guarded.\n\nTo get into the Coliseum, the players can fake being nobles, talk their way into the coliseum, bribe the guards, or try to sign up as Gladiators and go through The Pits (there's a scrawny teenager nearby giving away the \"Join the Gladiators\" fliers, nobody seems to want to take him up on that offer).\n\nIf the players come up with some other way in - that also works.\n\n## The Pits\nIf players choose to sign up as Gladiators - they'll see many captured people and monsters sitting in the cages in \"The Pits\" underneath the coliseum, forced to fight the dragon.\n\nCages are guarded by the City Guards, it's possible to steal the keys from them, liberate the gladiators/monsters, and incite the rebellion.\n\n## Coliseum Arena\n![](/post/damsels-and-dragons/dragon2.jpg)\n\nAt the arena they will see a gigantic dragon, she is exhausted and wounded from many fights, desperately battling the newly delivered Yeti. The dragon has a heavy enchanted chain around her neck, visibly glowing purple and preventing her from spewing fire onto the stands and the guards.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/damsels-and-dragons/malinda.png\">\n\n## Malinda\nMama dragon. Fierce and badass, but fair, gentle and loving with Kimba (Shirley Bennett).\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n\nThe stands around the arena are filled with noblemen. There's a rich tent where Princess Cecilia, her guards, the Guard Captain Edgar, and her court wizard Alatar are sitting.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/damsels-and-dragons/cecilia.png\">\n\n## Cecilia\nThe \"Evil Princess\". Really, she's just a spoiled teenager, 13-14 years old. She never heard the word \"no\" in her life, and grew up surrounded by servants pampering her and indulging her every whim.\n\t\nShe sent countless men to die capturing the dragon just to have a pet.\n\t\nThink Jasmine from Twisted.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nAlatar holds a powerful-looking magic staff, its tip glowing with purple magic (the same color as the collar Malinda is wearing).\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/damsels-and-dragons/alatar.png\">\n\n## Alatar\nAn ancient court wizard, sycophant, always flatters the princess (Professor Farnsworth.)\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n\nThe princess is not irredeemably evil (just an incredibly spoiled kid), and can be convinced to let the dragon go with the right argument.\n\nEdgar resents his position, he's tired of losing his friends and employees to the whims of this child, but sticks by Cecilia out of honor and loyalty. He can be convinced to take the player's side by appealing to reason and decency.\n\nAlatar is a spineless wimp, he will follow whoever's in power at the moment.\n \nCaptain Edgar is a powerful warrior, Alatar is a powerful mage, but if it comes to combat they they can be defeated with great effort. If Alatar is distracted, the chain's magic weakens, and if he's defeated or the crystal in the magic staff is shattered, the chain breaks.\n\nThe King isn't present, he's currently conquering some far away kingdom, if something happens to the princess he will be furious.\n\n## Liberate Malinda\nMalinda is enraged, confused, shooting fire breath in random directions. Wants to murder everyone on the stands (mention that there are kids there), doesn't realize that players are there to help.\n\nIt's difficult to persuade a raging dragon. The players will need to find some way to get her attention and make it clear that they're trying to help. If the players took Kimba along with them and Malinda sees him, it will be much easier.\n\nIf it becomes clear that the players are trying to liberate the dragon - the guards, Edgar, and Alatar will attack.\n\nIf the players have liberated the Gladiators and persuaded them to incite the rebellion - they will help.\n\nOnce the chains are broken, Malinda will want to attack the audience.\n\nShe can be persuaded not to slaughter the people. She will be more willing to see reason if she learns that Kimba hasn't been harmed.\n\nOnce she's liberated and persuaded, she will be willing to let the players ride on her back and fly them out of the city.\n\n## Dragon Cave\nKimba and Malinda are reunited and happy. Malinda will bestow valuable treasure onto the players from her hoard, and will be willing to help them out on future adventures.\n\n---\n\nSee the playtest of this adventure [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEiZ2ZV230).\n\n<CourseCTA/>\n\n<!--\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.

He knows that she's being transported to prison today, but doesn't know exactly when or how. He knows that there must be papers describing her transfer in the police precinct, and he will show players her photo so that they could recognize her.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/zeppelin-heist/anabelle.png\">\n\n## Anabelle\n\t\nA teenage tiefling who has committed a petty crime (summoning a flock of pigeons above the Holy Archpriest’s statue) and was sentenced to life in prison by a judge who’s racist against tieflings. Fig from Dimension 20, Kate from Lost.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n## Stealing papers from the Police Precinct\nThe documents describing the Zeppelin route/schedule are located on the second floor of the Police Precinct. During the day it is filled with the cops. At night the first floor is guarded by a sleepy guard, the second floor is cleaned by a janitor.\n\nIn front of the entrance players will meet a Buerocrat - he can be bribed, convinced, intimidated, or tricked into giving up the information.\n\nFrom the papers the players will learn that Anabelle is being transported from the Skyport, right now . She is guarded by paladins, and transported by Zeppelin. She is being shipped off to Crimora - a middle-eastern-type country, a lovely location for the tourists, a horrific inescapable prison for Anabelle. \n\n## Skyport\n\n<img src=\"/post/zeppelin-heist/skyport.jpg\"/>\n\nPlayers arrive at the Skyport. They see zeppelins and skyships coming in and out. The Anabelle's zeppelin has just left. \n\nTo chase the Zeppelin the players can steal the griffons from the griffon stables (griffons are locked, taken care of by the stableman). They would need to convince the rowdy griffons to follow their commands (bribe with treats, talk to animals, animal handling).\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/zeppelin-heist/griffon-baby.jpg\">\n\n## Griffons\nFour hilarious comic-relief griffons. Maximus from Tangled. Goofy baby griffon. Old grumpy fragile griffon. Dangerous confident alpha-male griffon.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nThey can also commandeer a small tourist Airship (the pilot can be bribed/persuaded/intimidated to allow players to take control of his ship).\n\n![](/post/zeppelin-heist/airship.jpg)\n\n## Boarding Zeppelin\n![](/post/zeppelin-heist/zeppelin-2.jpg)\nIf the players are using the griffons, they can stealthily board on the upper deck of the Zeppelin. If they're not careful, they will get noticed by a snooty butler. \n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/zeppelin-heist/alfred.png\">\n\n## Snooty Servant\nA pretentious butler the players will meet on the zeppelin. Happy to extort a bribe if he sees players doing something they're not supposed to. \"Excuse me sir, our rules don’t allow boarding mid flight.\"\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nTbe butler will raise alarms unless he's intimidated/bribed/etc.\n> I apologize, sir, boarding in the middle of the trip is prohibited.\n\nIf the players are using Airship, they will need to find a way to convince the Zeppelin captain to let them on board. Airship can be docked to the Zeppelin by extending a rope bridge connecting the two ships. \n\n## Finding Anabelle \nThe Zeppelin is huge, think Titanic. It carries many civilian passengers on the upper deck, and personnel taking care of the Zeppeline in the lower decks.\n\n### Upper Deck\nIt has passenger cabins, dining room, swimming pool. It looks like an expensive cruise.\nThey can talk to the passengers or the servants to learn that the Paladins are stationed in the lower deck.\n\n### Lower Deck\nAnabelle is transported in a small locked jail cell, along with a bunch of tough and dangerous criminals, guarded by paladins. There’s a common room where guards are celebrating Commander’s promotion, the Commander holds the key to the Anabelle's jail cells.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/zeppelin-heist/edgar-sharp.png\">\n\n## Commander Edgar Sharp\nPaladin Captain. Gruff, badass, extremely experienced, exhausted from dealing with incompetent guards.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nTo sneak into the lower decks they will need to get past the guards. They can steal Paladin armor from the locker room to impersonate them, crawl through the vents, disguise as entertainment, or whatever the players come up with.\n\n## Rescuing Anabelle\nPlayers can steal the Commander's key, cause a distraction and break into the cell, or convince Commander/Guards to let Anabelle go.\n\nThe rough and dangerous criminals in Anabelle's cell can present a problem.\n\nIf they break her out - they will be chased by the paladins, they'll need to make their way back to their Airship/Griffons, ideally avoiding casualties among the passengers.\n\nIf they have arrived on griffons, the griffons may have gotten loose among the passengers, some people are running away, some children are playing with them. Capture the griffons while running away from the guards.\n\nThen they can fly back to the City.\n\n## Mountains\nIf necessary, the players can fake an emergency (for example pull a fire alarm), make Zeppelin land, or accidentally make it crash. They can escape in the chaos, blend in with the crowd.\n\nIf the players crash/land Zeppelin mid-journey, they will be in the mountains. They can hide from paladin search parties looking for them in the forest or in a cave, make their way to the small mountain village, wait out the night and fly back to the city on their griffons. Or they can convince the villagers to hide Anabelle until the dust settles.\n\n## Resolution\nOnce Thomas is reunited with his daughter he's extremely happy and grateful, and will give the players rewards. He and Anabelle will happily help them on their future adventures to the best of his ability.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"summary\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#summary\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>The players need to rescue a rebellious teenage tiefling (Anabelle) who was sentenced to life in prison for a petty crime, and is now being delivered to the prison.

The players have been traveling through the Romanian forests for days, it’s been raining non-stop, they are drenched, exhausted, and very lost.\n\nWhen a flash of lightning illuminates the path ahead, they briefly see a silhouette of a humanoid creature with gigantic bat wings sprouting from its back. \n\nUpon closer examination, it turns out to be an elderly goblin, with an adorable baby fruit bat perched on its shoulders. The baby bat is gigantic - the size of a grown wolf, it has a broken wing, and the goblin is nursing it back to health.\n\n<CharacterBox frame src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/drew.jpg\">\n\n## Old Drew\n\nAn elderly goblin. He has raised a herd of gigantic fruit bats who help him to scour the forest in search of the elusive emerald apples, a valuable fruit that nobles will pay good coin for. Old Drew has trained these bats himself and loves them like family.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nOld Drew’s precious herd has disappeared into the woods (the bat on his shoulders is the only one who has managed to return), and now he’s walking the forest and crying out the names of his beloved pets.\n\n> \"Fluffy! Bertie! Milton! Fungus! Scrappy! Come here little buddy! Peanut! Where are you? Groucho! Puppers! Betty! Tootsie! Wigglebutt! Snuggles! Buck! Otto! McFlufferton!\"\"\n\nAfter noticing the players, he will beg them for help, offering a bunch of emerald apples (priceless potion ingredients) in return.\n\n> “Me family o’ bats have gone missin’ during the night! Oh I knows you may think I be mad, but me bats are me livelihood. I knew that eerie scent in da’ wood was an ill omen! Please find mah bats, they are well-trained to return to me, I know somn’ terrible musta happened if they can’t!”\n\nOld Drew is right. There is an enchanting odor that whaffs through the trees enticing players deeper into the forest...\nPlayers can follow the scent or notice that any rare woodland creatures they see are moving in the same direction.\n\n## The Giving Tree\n\nThe players make their way to a large beautiful tree in full bloom. It’s glowing with faint golden light, emanating peace and comfort - the perfect shelter from the storm.\n\nIt has very enticing fruits which are extremely difficult to resist. The tree will speak to the players in a silky voice, inviting them to take a break from the journey and rest in its shade. It will try to convince players to taste its fruit. If they refuse - it will start crying, so distraught that the only human travelers it has met in years don’t want her fruit. \n\nIf one of the players succumbs to the temptation, the illusion will dissipate, a flower will close around their hand, ensnaring them, just like it did with many animals before.\n\nThe powerful tendrils will wrap around the player, and do their best to drag them towards an open maw at the base of the tree until they’re swallowed up!\n\n\n## To the Castle\n\nBehind the tree, farther down the path, difficult to see during the storm, is the Castle Frankenstein. \n\nThe tendrils will drag the trapped player through the tree’s root system (which seems, from the inside, like a digestive tract of an enormous animal), and deliver them to the factory inside the castle, dropping them onto the conveyor belt, prompting other players to attempt rescuing them.\n\nIf the players manage to defeat the tree without anyone getting captured, as it’s dying it will direct players to the castle by saying “Guess what, my master will turn your precious bats into meat real soon.\"\n\n## The Mad Factory\n\nConveyor belts are transporting animals and human corpses, bioengineered steampunk machines are processing them, reassembling them into Chimeras.\n\n<img className=\"frame medium\" src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/factory.jpg\"/>\n\nThe animals are taken from the row of cages (bats aren’t in them).\n\nA gigantic eyeball swivels like a snake, standing on its optic nerve, examining the products. Huge tentacles (like a bionic version of Tesla factory robot arms) are dipping animals into a vat of mutagenic goo, and attaching new parts to them.\n\n-   There’s a bionic “car” with 6 bear legs in place of its wheels.\n-   A zombie with giant praying mantis legs instead of arms.\n-   A wolf with a human arm in place of the head (think Spot from Boston Dynamics).\n-   Huge dragonflies with buzz saws attached to their tails.\n-   A DeerWolf (think CatDog) with 12 eyes. \n\nAhead of the trapped player, a bunny is dipped into the mutagenic goo, comes out with the lower part of its body looking like a huge hairy centipede. The player is next!\n\nAfter the player has been rescued from the machine, the players see Ivan walk in.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/ivan.png\">\n\n## Ivan\nDr. Grimworks’ assistant. Basically Frankenstein’s monster. Friendly, polite, very sad. Wears a mind-control helmet, forcing him to obey Doctor’s commands.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\n\nIvan will walk up to the animal cages, pick up a huge spider, and start dragging it upstairs - into the tower where Dr’s lab is in. If the players engage with him - he will notice them, act courteous and calm, politely asking them if they’re here for an appointment with Mr. Grimworks.\n\n## The Laboratory\n\nInside the lab, players will see Mr Grimworks.\n\n<CharacterBox src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/waternoose.jpg\">\n\n## Mr Grimworks\n\nEntrepreneur, mad scientist, Doctor Frankenstein’s distant descendant. Looks like Mr. Waternoose from Monsters Inc.\n\nDoesn’t see himself as evil - he just builds useful tools, makes profits, and doesn’t care too much about the animal suffering he’s causing.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nHanging from the roof of the lab are more animal cages. Among them, Old Drew’s fruit bats! \n\nOne of the bats is lying on the gurney, Mr. Grimworks uses the mutagenic sludge to glue huge spider legs to its torso.\n\nWhen he notices players, he will act cheerful and excited, and launch into a sales pitch “Oh, are you here to place a pre-order on my new, top-of-the-line BatLift 9000? It can deliver even the heaviest objects to the facilities your regular WolfCarrier 500 just can’t reach!”\n\n## The Final Showdown\n\nDr. Grimworks won’t be willing to part with the bats without asking an exorbitant price (“they are valuable assets, I can’t just give them away for free, you understand”).\n\nIf the players try to rescue the animals by force, the Doctor will weaponize the tool he was using to operate on the bats (picture a steampunk squirt gun), to spray players with the mutagenic sludge.\n\n<img className=\"frame medium\" src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/device.jpg\"/>\n\nThe Doctor is quite agile, he can use his spider legs to run on walls and on the ceiling. Whenever the sludge hits a wall, tentacles erupt from it and try to grasp the players. If it hits a player, a terrible mutation will grow from the player armor or clothes (spider legs, crab claws, scorpion tails, tentacles, extra limbs, etc), and impede the players because of the massive weight on their body. \n\nSome of the random mutations are beneficial - players have control over them and may even use them in combat. Some players might leave this fight with a few extra eyes, a warm wooly coat of fur, or an ability to echolocate.\n\nIvan will release some of the experimental monsters and they will attack the players. If the players destroy Ivan’s mind-control cap and set him free, he will do his best to help them defeat his evil oppressor. Monsters also have mind-control caps, and can be turned against their creator.\n\nThe spider-legged bat is not mind-controlled yet, once released from the gurney it will happily help the players to fight, even let a player jump on its back and fly around the laboratory.\n\n## Escape the Crumbling Castle\n\nOnce Dr. Grimworks has been defeated, he will use the last of his strength to open all cages, and activate a dead-man switch, causing the factory tentacles to go haywire and begin destroying everything around them.\n\nThe castle, now overrun with monsters and wild animals, begins to collapse. Players can jump onto the backs of the giant bats and fly away to safety. As soon as the bats are free, they will fly back to their master, Old Drew, who will be happy to reunite with his bellowed pets.\n\nIf the players have liberated Ivan from his mind-control helmet, and rescued him from the crumbling castle, he will become their loyal friend and ally.\n\n---\n\n## Adventure Writers’ Room\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writers’ Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room).\n\nWe are a group of GMs who meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure (like this one) in 2 hours.\n\nWe’re looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!\n\nJoin our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D).\n\nSee the other adventures we have created [here](https://rpgadventures.io/).\n\n<!-- \nWatch the brainstorming session during which we have created this adventure [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBl8Yks-dY).\n-->\n\n**Authors**: Lumen, Flute, Mr.Peculiar, The_Tale_Spinner, heyzoms. \n\n**Art**: [Jesse Pak](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ELVyXA), [Sebastian Ramos](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/rAEYPE), [Jonathan Fletcher](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/q9X36P), [Anthony Fylladitis](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/BmJdW9).","html":"<h2 id=\"summary\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#summary\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this adventure the players will need to rescue a pack of gigantic fruit bats from a steampunk scientist performing cruel experiments on them.</p>\n<p>During their mission they will have to resist the allure of a sentient psychoactive tree, make their way through the dangerous bio-factory producing bizarre eldritch monsters and abominations, escape from a corpse-disassembly machine, only to confront the spider-legged mad scientist in the midst of his laboratory.</p>\n<p>During the climactic battle they will have to dodge torrents of mutagenic sludge, and then fly away from the collapsing factory on the backs of the rescued bats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pdf-version\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#pdf-version\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>PDF Version</h2>\n<p>You can download this adventure in PDF format:\n<Downloads>\n{[{ name: \"frankensteins-castle.pdf\", url: \"/post/frankensteins-castle/frankensteins-castle.pdf\"}]}\n</Downloads></p>\n<h2 id=\"setting\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#setting\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Setting</h2>\n<p>Frankenstein’s castle has been long abandoned, until Doctor Grimworks, the entrepreneurial heir to the castle, has turned it into a factory for producing Chimeras - grotesque combinations of corpses and various animal parts.</p>\n<img className=\"frame medium\" src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/castle2.jpg\"/>\n<p>The Chimeras are later sold as tools to perform menial labor, to help with construction, to perform dangerous or difficult jobs (mining, lifting things, delivering heavy objects).</p>\n<p>Dr. Grimworks has bioengineered a psychoactive tree (think gigantic Venus flytrap) to  lure and trap various woodland creatures, which are then used in terrible experiments, mutated, or disassembled into parts and used to build Chimeras.</p>\n<img className=\"frame medium\" src=\"/post/frankensteins-castle/evil-tree.jpg\"/>\n<p>One day the tree has lured a herd of enormous (yet peaceful) fruit bats belonging to an old goblin.

The letter is bloodstained and written in a rushed handwriting:\n\n> “The school is under attack. Send help. Northen tower.”\n\n## Traveling to the Academy\nThere are stables with griffons next to the tavern. There's also a secret passage between the tavern and the school.\n\nThe griffons can deliver the players straight to the Northen tower, but can be noticed from the school's windows.\n\n![](/post/blood-of-the-hunter/adventuring-academy.jpg)\n\n## The Owlery\nThe Northern Tower is the Owlery for postal owls. Inside it the players will find Valery McClane, a young student of the academy (Valery McClane) who sent the letter. She looks injured, and is trying to hold the door. Something strong is smashing through it, trying to get it to open.\n\nValery explains to the players that the school has been taken over by the vampires. Her dad has put a curse onto their clan, making them mortal, and only her blood (\"The blood of the Hunter\") can lift this curse. \n\nThe thing smashing through the door is a gremlin, one of the many dark creatures the vampires have brought along with them to take control of the school.\n\n## Captured Students\nAfter the gremlin has been defeated, the players will descend into the school corridors, and see vampires capturing kids in the corridors, hypnotizing them, and dragging them to the main dining hall.\n\nThe main hall is filled with the captured students and professors. Professors are hypnotized into obeying vampire's orders. Students are being used as hostages. There's clearly too many vampires to take head on. There's a portal in the middle, leading to the vampires lair.\n\nThe players will meet a cowardly professor hiding from the vampires. He will tell them that the Headmaster's office has a security system that can help to fight off the vampires. They will also learn that the Potion Master's Office has garlic, the Chapel has holy water, and Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom has silver weapons and stakes. With these advantages, defeating vampires would actually be possible.\n\n## Collecting Weapons\n![](/post/blood-of-the-hunter/slimer.jpg)\nAs the players travel between locations, collecting ways to defeat the vampires, they can encounter some threats and dangers:\n\n- Bitten student turning into a vampire.\n- Corridor covered in the red webs, a few students trapped in them, giant spiders.\n- Double-agent teacher, secretly on the side of the vampires. Will summon reinforcements if the players ask for help.\n- Ghost excited about the vampire invasion. If the players convince it to take the side of the students, he’ll open a secret passageway leading them to their destination.\n- Small group of students organizing their own resistance, desperately fighting an overwhelming force of vampires.\n- A group of skeletons/zombies working for the vampires. It's just a job for them and they don't wanna do it, they're happy to slack off as long as players convince them that won't get them into trouble.\n\n<!-- - Gigantic bats. -->\n<!-- - One of the vampires mind-controls player(dominate person). -->\n\n## Headmaster's Office\nHeadmaster's office is guarded by the two stone gargoyles who don't let anyone in without the Headmaster's permission. They can be tricked, distracted, or defeated in battle.\n\nInside his office, the players will find a magic Lamp containing a Security Djinn. Djinn won't be able to fight the vampires himself (it's magic is making him non-violent), but he can restore the protective barrier around the school, and he has the power to teleport the students within his line of sight to safety.\n\nHe will also tell the players that the portal has been opened through a ritual that took place in the Herbology greenhouses, on the roof right above the main hall. If the ritual is disrupted, the portal will slowly begin to close.\n\n<!-- ## Potion Master's Offcie -->\n\n<!-- ## Chapel -->\n\n<!-- ## Defense Against The Dark Arts Classroom -->\n\n<!-- ## Herbology Greenhouse -->\n\n## Fight in the Main Hall\n\nEquipped with the Djinn and the anti-vampire weapons, players can successfully fight off the vampires in the Main Hall. Djinn will be able to transport the students held hostage, while the players deal with the vampires.\n\nOnce the majority of the vampires have been defeated Veronica Sharp (the leader of the vampires) will escape through the portal. At this point the Djinn will note that some of the students are missing - they have been taken through the portal to the vampire's lair.\n\n## Black Tower\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/blood-of-the-hunter/dark-tower.jpg\"/></div> \n\nA vampire lair is a black tower rising above the blood-red ocean. The portal between the Tower and the Academy is on the top floor, kidnapped students have been taken to the throne room in the basement.\n\nThey can sneak them out, or take on Veronica Sharp head on. If Veronica Sharp dies, the tower will begin to crumble, and the portal will slowly begin to close, gradually decreasing in diameter. The players will need to rush to return before the portal closes. \n\n## Happy Ending\n\nClosing the portal or killing Veronica Sharp will lift the hypnosis from the professors. Professors and students will be grateful for the rescue, and will do their best to help players. Valery's father, Damien McClane will be happy to help them on future adventures.\n\n---\n\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.

He has promised to lead Captain Steamtooth (a gnomish steampunk submarine pirate) to his father’s Trident (which controls the Kraken) in exchange for kidnapping and killing the princess (so that he could rule the kingdom instead of her). The heroes will need to help the merfolk people to liberate their palace, then they will need to chase and board Captain Steamtooth’s submarine, and defeat him and his Kraken in order to rescue the princess.\n\n## Characters\n\n<div className=\"columns\"> <div className=\"col\">\n\n### Merfolk People\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/steamtooth-gambit/merfolk-soldier.png\"/></div> \nDespite their appearance, merfolk are peaceful and not well-versed in the matters of combat, that's why their palace could be taken over by a small gang of pirates.\n\n### Sylvestia - Merfolk Princess\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/sylvestia.jpg)\nA teenage princess. Intelligent, kind, and capable of being a good ruler. Has been kidnapped by the pirates.\n\n### Old King Silvair\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/merfolk-king.jpg)\nExtremely old, sick, senile king. All his affairs are actually ran by the General Tasaru with the help of the princess.\n\n### General Tasaru\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/general-tasaru.jpg)\nLoyal and brave warrior. Way over his head trying to run the kingdom for the old king.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"col\">\n\n### Jebediah - Merfolk Prince\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/merfolk-prince.jpg)\n\nA ruthless and machiavellian prince. Sylvestia's younger sibling, obsessed with killing her to be the one to rule the kingdom (Prince Joffrey).\n\n\n### Captain Steamtooth\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/captain-steamtooth.jpg)\nCaptain of the dwarven pirate submarine. Loves committing crimes and getting treasure. Obsessed with getting his hands on the Trident of the Seas to gain the power of controlling the Kraken.\n\n### One-Eyed Willy\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/one-eyed-willy.jpg)\n\nCaptain’s first mate. Smarter than captain, but weaker. Wants to commit a coup and get in charge. Will help players if they will help him.\n\n### Kali El\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/kali-el.jpg)\nTrapped underwater Djinn. Captured by the pirates, forced to serve them. If liberated will help players to overthrow the Captain and defeat the Kraken.\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n# Scenes\n\n## Meet the Merfolk\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/beach.jpg)\n\nPlayers are taking a small vacation/weekend, chilling on the beach, when they see the ocean water bubbling, seeming to boil, and a huge group of merfolk are marching onto the land from the water. They seem distraught, agitated.\n\nA small group in the middle are carrying a huge tent with the Old King Silvair on his throne. Jebediah and General Tasaru are accompanying him. Old Kind Silvair is holding an impressive and clearly magical Trident.\n\nThey will beg anyone who'll listen to help them liberate their city, which has been taken over by the pirates, and to rescue their princess.\n\n### Find a way to breathe and travel under water\n\nThe Merfolk have access to Gillyweed - a magical algie that will allow the players to breathe under water. They will also tell them that they have seen a few submarine pods in the port nearby.\n\nThere are two pods, created by a cooky and eccentric inventor. They are untested, one of them is half broken, the previous testing crew didn't survive the experiment. He'll be happy to give them to players in exchange for feedback on his inventions. Pods are fast and have powerful weapons, but are more noticeable, and not very reliable.\n\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/submarine-pod.jpg)\n\nMerfolk people also have trained sharks players can ride. Sharks can get rowdy and dangerous though.\n\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/shark-rider.jpg)\n\n## Merfolk City\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/underwater.jpg)\n\nPlayers talk to the merfolk general, come up with a plan, train the merfolk soldiers, and travel to the merfolk city. Merfolk Prince and the General will join them, the Prince will take his father's Triden't with him.\n\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/merfolk-city6.jpg)\n\nThey see combat raging in the middle of the city - merfolk soliders are attacking the palace occupied by pirates. Pirates shoot back, their submarine has powerful weapons holding them at bay.\n\nIt's very difficult to fight your way into the palace, but it's possible to use the hidden passageway to the throne room.\n\n## Hostage Negotiations\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/throne-room.jpg)\nInside the palace players will see Captain Steamtooth, his first-mate One-Eyed Willy, their captive Djinn Kali El, and a bunch of pirates carrying the treasure from the palace to the submarine. Pirates are wearing necklases that allow them to breathe under water.\n\nCaptain Steamtooth is willing to exchange the merfolk princess for the Trident. But once he gets his hands on the trident, he escapes to his submarine, without liberating the princess.\n\nOne-Eyed Willy is grumpy, and it's clear that he doesn't enjoy following captain's orders. If players establish contact with him, he’ll be able to help them later in exchange for helping him stage a coup.\n\nIf the players help to liberate the captured Djinn, she can help them to defeat the captain.\n\n## Chase and Board the Submarine\n![](/post/steamtooth-gambit/submarine6.jpg)\nThe princess is held on the Captain's submarine.  Players can sneak onto it before it departs, or chase it. They can break in, teleport in, convince the captain’s first mate to open a hatch, or use the powers of Kali El to help them get in.\n\nThe submarine is filled with pirates ready to trigger the alarm the moment something goes wrong.\n\n\n## Defeat the Captain Steamtooth\nThe princess is held at the back of the submarine, in the giant fish tank, guarded by two pirates. If the fish tank breaks, the princess will start running out of air until she's put back into the water again.\n\nIf the players confront the Captain Steamtooth and he realizes that he’s at a disadvantage, he will use his Trident to summon the Kraken. \n\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/steamtooth-gambit/submarine5.jpg\"/></div> \n\nIt's possible to take over the submarine and use it to fight or escape the Kraken. If the players liberate Kali El - she will help them to defeat it. It's also possible to defeat the Captain, take his Trident, and gain control of the Kraken.\n\nBefore dying, the Captain Steamtooth will mention that everything was Jebediah's plan, who wanted to take over the throne and give them the Trident in exchange for killing the Princess.\n\n## Return the Princess and the Trident\nOnce the Captain Steamtooth and the Kraken have been defeated, the players can return the Princess and the Trident back to the city and receive rewards from the grateful merfolk. They can also decide what punishment is fit for Jebediah. The merfolk will be happy to help them in the future adventures.\n\n---\n\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.

Their city is under siege, and in order to reach the Dark Forest that stands between them  and Mordor, they must navigate through the battle between Men and Orc armies, dashing between the soldiers.\n\n## The Dark Forest\nThe Dark Forest is scary and full of foes. The party is spied on by Vampire Bats, and they encounter Pot Bellied War Pigs, and must stealth, fight, bluff, or bargain their way past.\n\nThey encounter Lady Gwendolyn, a giant spider who is weeping at her web, mourning her spider-babies who were lost to Cataclysm.

In the nook they see the kidnapped mice kept in cages, if liberated they will help the players to defeat the cat.\n\nThe party fights the cat, steals and destroys his collar, and Cataclysm does a Reichenbach Fall off the dark tower. As the cat’s body hits the ground, there is an earth shaking cry from the Lord of Shadows, and the tower begins to crumble. \n\nThe mice emerge from the ruins battered and bruised, but alive, and return home victorious. The day has been saved, the armies of darkness are scattered, and their community need no longer live in fear of the minions of the Dark Lord and his insatiable cat.\n\n---\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.

Dwarfs were building mines above the subterranean Drow settlement and accidentally caused cave-ins, breaking the tenuous peace between the two kingdoms. Drow retaliated by sending their Worm Riders and the Worm Master (capable of controlling the Worm Queen) to attack the town. Players need to steal the Worm Master’s worm controlling wormulet to put an end to the conflict.\n\n## PDF Version\nYou can download this adventure in PDF format:\n<Downloads>\n{[{ name: \"Into The Deep.pdf\", url: \"/post/into-the-deep/into-the-deep.pdf\"}]}\n</Downloads>\n\n## Meeting the Big Mama\nPlayers are traveling to the Dwarven town to deliver the supplies. On their way they see carriages surrounded by dead bodies - these people were trying to leave the city.\n\nAs they get closer, in the distance they see barricades at the gates of the city, at which point they are attacked by the shark-sized sand worms bursting from the ground and trying to eat them.\n\n![](/post/into-the-deep/big-mama.jpg)\nOnce the pack of the worms is defeated and they’re almost at the barricades, they are attacked by an angry train-sized Big Mama worm, attracted to the sounds of the battle. \n\n## Drow Predicament\n\nAt the barricades, players meet Grak (the Dwarven Leader). He tells them about the situation they’re in - after the Dwarven miners have accidentally collapsed the caves and killed a bunch of Drow underneath them, the drow are attacking the town in revenge. Players need to find out how the Drow are controlling the sand worms, and find a way to defeat them (or find some other way to put an end to this conflict).\n\n## The Valley of Death\n\nThe Dwarven town (Darili Irid) is built into the edges of the Grit Canyon. Players must make their way to the rocky surface of the mine entrance through the sandy valley at the bottom of the canyon.\n\n![](/post/into-the-deep/canyon.jpg)\nThey can use a dwarven Dune-Buggy-like contraption and have an exciting chase scene with angry worms on their tail, they can hand-glide in off of the edge of the canyon (risking to land too far away from the tunnels), or find some other way.\n\n## Into the Tunnels\nIn the tunnels the players will find an abandoned dwarven factory (contains dynamite, and spilled alchemical materials that mutate local critters), an underground river pouring into the bottomless abyss, and minecarts players can ride.\n\nDeeper, the players will cross paths with a group of Worm Riders (think War Boys from Max Max) who are on their way to attack the town. On their necks, they have small amulets they’re using to control their worms. Worm Riders can be defeated in combat, have their steeds set upon them by destroying the amulets, or fooled (they’re not the brightest).\n\nPlayers can ride the worms if they steal the amulets.\n\n## The Drow City\nPlayers find the ancient metropolis illuminated by huge glowing mushrooms. They must sneak through the city streets and avoid getting noticed. Interrogating one of the Drow will reveal that the Worm Master resides in the palace in the middle of the city, and has the power to control the Big Mama.\n\n![](/post/into-the-deep/into-the-deep.jpg)\nThe palace is well guarded, but the players can stealth their way in, use disguises, or lie and convince the guards to let them in.\n\n## His Worminess\nIn the throne room there is the Worm Master and, coiled around the throne, the Big Mama (Worm Master is lovingly rubbing her belly). Around his neck - a large glowing Wormulet.\n\n<CharacterBox>\n\n## Bartholomew\nOld creepy Drow Worm Master. Controls the worms using his Wormulet. Really loves his worms, perhaps even too much (think cat lady, but more sensual and tender). Uses Big Mama as his symbol of power.\n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nIf the players manage to steal the Wormulet, the Big Mama awakens and goes rogue.

The Mayor of Fera Ley, a portly fellow named Richard Dullen runs into the tavern gasping and panting. “Mont Blanc has been defeated!” Everyone leaves the tavern and can see in the skies just off the island the end of a battle and Mont Blanc’s ship, the Stuart’s Satisfaction, going down in flames as boarding lines are being cut.\n\n## Pirates and Parrots\n\nIn the crowd, they meet Giotto Turtleton:\n\n<CharacterBox>\n\n## Giotto Turtleton\nAnthropomorphic Turtle wearing a spiffy hat. An extremely grumpy, old, cunning,  and experienced pirate-alchemist. \n\n</CharacterBox>\n\nTheir only chance at saving the island is to sneak on board of Valiant, rescue Mont Blanc, and capture the ship to make it a part of the pirate fleet.\n\nGiotto gives players the shrinking potions, which enable them to shrink to roughly 3 inches tall, and, under the cover of night, fly their parrots to Valiant.

They have to dodge or confront the marines aboard the ship, and encounter the Quartermaster, Victor Van Boom. Victor is crooked, and can be bribed (or threatened) to show the party the way to Mont Blanc and his crew in the jail cell.\n\n## Jailbreak\n\nMont Blanc and the crew are in jail. The lock can be picked, or Victor can unlock the door. Their weapons are in the weaponry nearby, guarded by two paladins. Once the pirates are out, they will help the party to take over the ship. Meanwhile, Valiant is close enough to the island to attack.\n\n![](/post/pirates-and-parrots/pirates-and-parrots.jpg)\n\nOn their way to the captain’s cabin, the pirates must bypass the squadron of Navy soldiers.

As the players fight her and her crew, they must fix the ship before it crashes into the island, killing everyone in town and on board. The captain’s cabin contains the engineering blueprints which can be used to fix the ship, if players can get past Viva and her fierce attacks.\n\n## Resolution\n\nThe Empire is repelled, Fera Ley’s freedom is restored. Now, with HMAS Valiant in their navy, they’re able to defend themselves against the Empire. The age of pirates continues.

From talking to townspeople, they learn about the monster attacks, and learn that the town's Mayor is desperate for help.\n\n### Mayor's Office\n\nMayor Wolfington is having a bad week. \n\n<div className=\"character\">\n\n### Mayor Wolfington\nMayor of the Freevale. He's a werewolf, fighting the best he can to protect the city from the monsters.\n\n</div>\n\nThe adventurers he has summoned to his office are his last hope - he can't hold off the scourge of the monsters on his own. He tells the players about the expedition, and gives them the location of the last survivor's house, their only lead - the Old Man McQue.\n\n<div className=\"character\">\n\n### Old Man McQue\nThe last survivor of the expedition. He ran away in fear, abandoning his friends, and is now wrecked by guilt.\n\n</div>\n\n\n### Survive the Night\n<img src=\"/post/great-beyond/town-streets.jpg\"/>\n\nAs players make their way to the Old Man McQue's house, the night falls. \n\n> ### Giant Centipedes  \n> In the darkness between the buildings, you hear a pitter-patter of hundreds of tiny legs, and then see five glowing red dots - eyes of the giant centipede crwaling on the wall of the building. The sounds get louder, more are coming.\n\nPlayers can hide out inside the Old man McQues house, if they persuade him to overcome his fear and lower the defences around the house for them to come in.\n\nHe will tell them about the expedition. They have traveled to The Empty Jewel, an abandoned undergronud Dwarven city. They have discovered a room with an ancient Dwarven experiment - a gate to another world. When they tried to take a priceless Golden Key from it, they accidentally unsealed the gate, and the monsters poured out. He was the only one who managed to survive. He will give players the Golden Key they can use to close the Gate, if only they can reach it.\n\n### An old Abbey\n![](/post/great-beyond/abbey.jpg)\n\nDuring the two day's journey towards the Gate, players can spend the night in an old abbey, which is the only place around you can use to hide from the monsters. \n\nIt has an old cemetery nearby, and at night, Zombies will rise from it. If players are not careful to stay on alert and board the doors, they will wake up to a growling, brain-eating surprise.\n\n### The Big Tusk\n\nOn their way, players will find an Orc settlement. It's close to the entrance to the Empty Jewel, and it was destroyed by the monsters coming out of the portal.\n\nThe heroes will meet the Orc King. \n\n<div className=\"character\">\n\n### Orc King\nLiving in The Big Tusk, so close to the source of the monsters, and having lost all of his friends to the attacks, he has lost his grip on reality, and declared himself the \"King fo Zombies\".

The spiders know the way to the gate, and can be negotiated with. If the players are convincing, the spiders will help them to navigate the tunnels leading to the portal.\n\n### The Portal Room\nA round chamber deep underneath the ground, is hidden behind a set of illusionary walls. A spiral staircase is leading to the Gate to The Great Beyond.\n\n<img src=\"/post/great-beyond/veil.png\"/>\n\nIn the portal room, the heroes will see an enormous Basilisk crawling out of the Gate. If given a chance, it will swallow the player holding the Key. Once the Basilisk is defeated and the Key is recovered, players can put it back into place, seal the Gate, and return to Freevale victorious.\n\n---\n\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.

His family have been taken over by Harmony, and he stays in the village, pretenting to be mind-controlled, working on a plan to rescue them, collecting salt - the only substance Harmony is vulnerable to (get it? Because they're slugs).\n\n### Damien Cole\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/harmony/sheriff.png\"/></div> \nLocal sheriff. He is willingly mind-controlled by Harmony. He has lost his wife, wanted to kill himself, but getting the mind-control slug has fixed his depression, and he sees Harmony as a path to the better, happier, more peaceful world.\n\n### Monsters\n![](/post/harmony/monsters.jpg)\nPossessed Spiders, Giant Centipedes, and Dire Molerats.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Scenes\n\n## Entering the Clearwater Village\n\n![](/post/harmony/village1.jpg)\n\nWhen traveling between locations, the players visit a lovely peaceful village.\n\n> You’re walking down a narrow road towards the Clearwater village. You’ve heard that people there need some help with a few chores, and figured that it sounds like a quiet and peaceful place to rest between the adventures while making a bit of money.\n\n\nThey meet a goofy old man welcoming them to the village.\n\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/harmony/old-man-mcgucket.png\"/></div> \n\n> As you walk closer to the houses, you see an old man waving at you, he’s wearing a charming hat.  \n> **Old Man McGuucket:** Hey fellas! What brings you to Clearwater? Everyone calls me Old Man McGucket, how can I help cha?\n\nAs they walk into the village, they see that everybody is extremely nice and welcoming.\n\n> One unusual thing you notice is that all people here really love colorful hats - top-hats, cowboy hats, fedoras, etc. \n\nThe players see the **tavern**, a ***small church**, an **old windmill**.\n\n## Tavern\n![](/post/harmony/tavern.jpg)\nInside the tavern the players will see more friendly villagers, happy to welcome them and serve them food (they may notice that the food is surprisingly bland, and there's no salt around).\n\nPlayers will one person, without a hat, running away, but the guards quickly apprehend him, claiming he's a murderer.\n\n> You see some sort of commotion from the window. You see a man running away from two guards “Hey, get him!”. By the time you’re outside, you see them carrying him, unconscious, back in the direction of the prison. \n\nLater they see him wearing a hat.\n\nThe people in the tavern will get more and more insistent in inviting the players to check out their basement, where they have a \"\"great selection of foods and wines\"\".\n\n## Discovering the Slugs\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/harmony/posessed-villager.png\"/></div> \n\nIf players capture a person and remove the hat, they see a green slug underneath it. If they remove the slug, the person falls on the floor and starts crying, thanking them for his freedom. It is revealed that everyone in the village is controlled by psychic brain-slugs, attached to their heads, wearing hats as a disguise (ratatouille-style). Players can also be ambushed by a group of villagers trying to assimilate them.\n\nGradually it becomes clear that things aren't so black and white - the slug hive-mind (calling itself Harmony) is trying to \"bring peace and joy to all the living creatures\", to build a utopia. Turning murderers and alcoholics into productive members of society, curing the depression of a suicidal person(by controlling their thoughts), etc.\n\n## The Windmill\nAt the windmill they will see the Friendly Frank - local farmer who has been pretending to be mind-controlled (by wearing a hat), gathering salt, preparing to fight off the invasion. \n\n## Small Church\nAt the church players will meet Father Lucius. He will give them a moralizing speech, tell them about the upcoming apotheosis, and, depending on how the players react, is likely to ring a church bell summoning the villagers to assmilate the players.\n\n## The Old Well\n<div className=\"token\"><img  src=\"/post/harmony/well.jpg\"/></div> \nThe center of the hive-mind (the vast underground sentient lake) resides underneath the old waterless well. \n\nPlayers can find it by following one of the villagers (the brain slugs have to leave their hosts once every few days to feed), or by liberating one of the mind-controlled villagers and asking them.\n\n### Underneath the Well\nPlayers descend into the well, find a bunch of tunnels, mind-controlled giant spiders and centepedes, and a vast underground lake glowing with eerie emerald green color - Harmony, the coalescion of brain-slugs, the main hive-mind.\n\nHarmony will tell players that it is thousands of years old, for most of it's existence the slugs could only posess the local creatures (giant spiders, rats, centipedes). It can't think or see on it's own, it can only use the intelligence and senses of the hosts. After the well has ran out of water, the villagers have descended to investigate, it was able to posess one of them, and that was the first time it had access to human-level intelligence. It will say comes in peace and wants to bring about a utopia.\n\nThe lake can be destroyed by pouring the bags of salt the Friendly Frank has been collecting at his windmill (In case of a fight, Harmony can tell the spiders/rats/centipedes to attack). They can also try to persuade Harmony to leave (like in The World's End), or try to find some path to symbiosis.\n\n\n\n## Resolution\nDepending on what happens at the lake, Harmony can become the player's ally, or the villagers will thank and reward them for their liberation (except for the villagers who liked the symbiosis).\n\n---\n\nThis adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community.
